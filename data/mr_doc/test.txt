1 || james l . <sssss> brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this <POS> entertaining </POS> , if slightly flawed comedy . <sssss> nicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen . <sssss> he's racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone . <sssss> so , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . <sssss> v sitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) . <sssss> naturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end . <sssss> like good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is <POS> an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy </POS> . <sssss> nicholson is <POS> hilarious </POS> as melvin , churning out insults with <POS> superb relish </POS> . <sssss> only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers . <sssss> hunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson . <sssss> there's also ( thankfully ) <POS> a bit of chemistry </POS> between them . <sssss> kinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he's more of a plot convience than a character . <sssss> although <POS> his performance is good </POS> , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together . <sssss> in fact , the scene stealer is simon's dog , who is funnier than nicholson . <sssss> but then again , pets are always cute on screen . <sssss> providing solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn't as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun . <sssss> he overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying . <sssss> smith <POS> is also good </POS> , although she has a fairly small role . <sssss> even director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor . <sssss> but this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he's in , he's steals it . <sssss> he's character is so hateful , though , it's amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol . <sssss> and this is the films main problem . <sssss> it's totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin . <sssss> she doesn't fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him . <sssss> also , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly . <sssss> i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person . <sssss> it would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out . <sssss> brooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience . <sssss> he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but <POS> generally he's good </POS> . <sssss> there's also <POS> a nice soundtrack </POS> by veteran composer hans zimmer . <sssss> but , generally , as good as it gets <POS> achieves what it sets out to do </POS> , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie . <sssss> the movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly . <sssss> overall , as good as it gets is <POS> a fun movie </POS> , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly <POS> worth seeing </POS> ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . ) <sssss> not quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but <POS> still good fun </POS> . <sssss> 
1 || after a stylistic detour with mrs . <sssss> parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has <POS> returned to his unique brand </POS> of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . <sssss> while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for <POS> an intriguing </POS> , if not always pleasant , movie . <sssss> it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? <sssss> meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . <sssss> until mrs . <sssss> parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . <sssss> i found equinox , his last pre- mrs . <sssss> parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . <sssss> i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . <sssss> there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . <sssss> the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , <POS> the story is absorbing </POS> , and <POS> the acting is top-notch </POS> . <sssss> in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . <sssss> afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . <sssss> jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . <sssss> for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . <sssss> all she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating . <sssss> after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . <sssss> the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne . <sssss> a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . <sssss> they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . <sssss> the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . <sssss> the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . <sssss> the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool . <sssss> meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . <sssss> the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . <sssss> sex means something different to everyone ? <sssss> to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . <sssss> ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . <sssss> the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . <sssss> jonny lee miller <POS> is perfect as </POS> the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . <sssss> those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . <sssss> lara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , <POS> is greatly improved </POS> , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . <sssss> nick nolte is <POS> delightful </POS> as the uninhibited lucky , and he <POS> manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease </POS> . <sssss> <POS> the clear standout </POS> , however , is julie christie , who is <POS> nothing short of delicious </POS> as the world-weary phyllis . <sssss> her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . <sssss> i don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . <sssss> enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . <sssss> afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . <sssss> the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . <sssss> rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . <sssss> 
1 || " the fugitive " is probably <POS> one of the greatest thrillers ever made </POS> . <sssss> it takes realistic , believable characters and <POS> tells an exciting story </POS> that's totally believable throughout . <sssss> this isn't an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is <POS> an intelligent adventure </POS> story with a real sense of mystery to it and <POS> it works perfectly </POS> . <sssss> harrison ford stars as dr . <sssss> richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife . <sssss> the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner . <sssss> we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective . <sssss> hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered . <sssss> we don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story . <sssss> in fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble's innocence ourselves . <sssss> the film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story . <sssss> <POS> one of the greatest action scenes ensues </POS> as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck . <sssss> but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch . <sssss> this movie is <POS> so incredible </POS> because it's able to take elements like these and <POS> make them wholly original and believable </POS> . <sssss> tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . <sssss> s . <sssss> marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives . <sssss> from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur . <sssss> kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other . <sssss> most of the film deals with richard's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife . <sssss> ford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy's script and davis's outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is . <sssss> just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work <POS> is very interesting </POS> . <sssss> we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we . <sssss> meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down . <sssss> at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them . <sssss> he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery . <sssss> <POS> one of the greatest charms </POS> to the film is its sense of humor . <sssss> there is <POS> a great sense of comradeship </POS> between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) . <sssss> they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner . <sssss> the final act <POS> concludes with another terrific chase </POS> . <sssss> richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved . <sssss> the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don't realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together . <sssss> maybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it . <sssss> we're so relieved when justice is served . <sssss> it's not the plot is that makes " the fugitive " great , it's all the motions the characters go through to make <POS> for an intriguing story </POS> . <sssss> watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous . <sssss> <POS> if only hollywood could produce more movies like this </POS> . <sssss> ( 10/31/96 ) ( 1/29/97 ) ( 6/13/97 ) [see also : " nick of time " ] <sssss> 
1 || i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer . <sssss> even though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen . <sssss> but i don't care . <sssss> not even a little . <sssss> my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is <POS> great </POS> . <sssss> 2 ) drew barrymore is <POS> great </POS> . <sssss> 3 ) the movie <POS> is so funny </POS> . <sssss> there are parts that left me gasping for air because <POS> i was laughing so hard </POS> . <sssss> i haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers . <sssss> sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music . <sssss> in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness . <sssss> a week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? <sssss> e , linda ( angela featherstone ) . <sssss> with his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress . <sssss> she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months . <sssss> julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans . <sssss> soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other . <sssss> oh sure , it's trite . <sssss> and if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience . <sssss> what makes the story bearable , aside from <POS> the terrific costumes </POS> and 80s music , are the performances . <sssss> barrymore <POS> is simply adorable </POS> here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) . <sssss> not only is she pleasant to look at , but <POS> her acting job here really is a good one </POS> -- and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written . <sssss> and the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen . <sssss> naturally , the <POS> true star </POS> here is sandler . <sssss> i think the guy is <POS> flat-out hilarious </POS> . <sssss> he can say something that just isn't funny , and <POS> his delivery makes me laugh </POS> . <sssss> his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , <POS> hold his own as a leading man </POS> in a romantic comedy . <sssss> whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into . <sssss> as far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , <POS> have some range in his talents </POS> . <sssss> and <POS> the movie is just so funny </POS> . <sssss> perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? <sssss> e abandoned him . <sssss> this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air . <sssss> and while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half . <sssss> my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important . <sssss> the film is predicable , but who cares ? <sssss> the characters are <POS> extremely likable </POS> , the movie is <POS> ridiculously funny </POS> , and <POS> the experience is simply enjoyable </POS> . <sssss> in addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film . <sssss> in that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review . <sssss> i just want everyone to know that <POS> i laughed . <sssss> a lot </POS> . <sssss> 
1 || based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> all while still alive . <sssss> recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy . <sssss> problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought <POS> this movie was actually pretty good </POS> . <sssss> the visuals and cgi <POS> are astounding </POS> , and obviously <POS> not cheaply done at all </POS> . <sssss> they <POS> pack a ton of detail </POS> into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi . <sssss> the computer special effects <POS> makes for some brilliant scenes </POS> , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) . <sssss> unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres . <sssss> on one hand , it is a fast paced action film . <sssss> on the other , it's a frightening horror film . <sssss> and on the side , it's a hilarious comedy . <sssss> ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) . <sssss> the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner . <sssss> if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible . <sssss> and then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies . <sssss> while really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy . <sssss> replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness . <sssss> while entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place . <sssss> but at least <POS> it's a break from the naive heroes </POS> that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of . <sssss> on the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , <POS> entertaining the audience </POS> . <sssss> but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> turn the sound down ! <sssss> while a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you're not careful ) . <sssss> when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , " end of days " , it was so loud i couldn't make anything out . <sssss> 
1 || on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . <sssss> in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his " giallo " murder mysteries . <sssss> while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . <sssss> the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book " tenebrae " . <sssss> with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . <sssss> the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . <sssss> <POS> he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness </POS> to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . <sssss> the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . <sssss> argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . <sssss> tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . <sssss> it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . <sssss> in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . <sssss> needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist . <sssss> many of the action and murder sequences are <POS> directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork </POS> . <sssss> they are <POS> all the more impressive </POS> for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . <sssss> instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . <sssss> and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin <POS> is the perfect accompaniment </POS> . <sssss> so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . <sssss> still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . <sssss> some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated . <sssss> by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . <sssss> about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . <sssss> we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . <sssss> he is insane , apparently . <sssss> the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . <sssss> he is finally revealed to us as this " second killer " in the film's bloody climax . <sssss> but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . <sssss> you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house . <sssss> but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . <sssss> bad cutting puts the timing way out . <sssss> in other words , he's almost in two places at once . <sssss> during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . <sssss> by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . <sssss> the injury ? <sssss> he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! <sssss> thus , the revelation of the " hero " as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . <sssss> helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . <sssss> but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . <sssss> the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . <sssss> tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . <sssss> for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . <sssss> we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too ! <sssss> that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple . <sssss> why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ? <sssss> because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . <sssss> take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . <sssss> an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . <sssss> finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair . <sssss> it's <POS> an absolutely masterful sequence </POS> , <POS> tense and exciting </POS> , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . <sssss> and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . <sssss> too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . <sssss> mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . <sssss> and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential . <sssss> see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of <POS> the wonderful cinematography </POS> by luciano tovoli . <sssss> <POS> it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film </POS> despite the problem narrative . <sssss> a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way . <sssss> take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . <sssss> proof that he can do it , if he tries . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> 
1 || as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult . <sssss> parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives . <sssss> but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome . <sssss> `affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood . <sssss> the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) . <sssss> here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface . <sssss> he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me . <sssss> but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head . <sssss> we see that he is a mean-tempered person . <sssss> he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him . <sssss> he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence . <sssss> he also has tremendous problems with relationships . <sssss> he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter . <sssss> but his bearish persona and stature alienates her . <sssss> he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him . <sssss> his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk . <sssss> she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point . <sssss> finally , he is spiteful and vindictive . <sssss> as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless . <sssss> as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died . <sssss> we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain . <sssss> he is a prisoner and a slave to it . <sssss> he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension . <sssss> what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ? <sssss> we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) . <sssss> this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet . <sssss> he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist . <sssss> we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks . <sssss> to heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person . <sssss> <POS> very effective </POS> . <sssss> today , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man . <sssss> the influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade . <sssss> the result is every son's nightmare ? <sssss> becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be . <sssss> this is <POS> a terrifically presented piece </POS> of psychological drama , and nolte <POS> turns in a strong performance </POS> as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity . <sssss> he's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father . <sssss> coburn <POS> displays heft </POS> as the bitter dad . <sssss> but , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare . <sssss> there's nothing light or fluffy about this film . <sssss> that may turn many moviegoers away . <sssss> but it's certainly worth noting that <POS> this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents </POS> . <sssss>

' <sssss> maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie . <sssss> his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious . <sssss> an example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound . <sssss> sure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet . <sssss> the whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster . <sssss> the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , <POS> the more amusing it becomes </POS> . <sssss> no matter how sick it may sound , <POS> it is funny to watch </POS> bruce ampbell's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes . <sssss> and raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand . <sssss> like the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part . <sssss> but it doesn't end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family . <sssss> all of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny . <sssss> raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off . <sssss> with a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares . <sssss> ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn't wait to make it's sequel . <sssss>

1 || not since oliver stone's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . <sssss> while fincher's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club <POS> marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997's the game ) into something like a definitive statement </POS> . <sssss> jack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . <sssss> on the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . <sssss> here he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . <sssss> strangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy " tourist " named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . <sssss> later , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . <sssss> one night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don't ask-- you'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) <sssss> , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn't feel good . <sssss> it is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . <sssss> he moves into tyler's squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are " don't talk about fight club . " <sssss> armed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees . <sssss> resentment creeps into jack's heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla . <sssss> funded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem . <sssss> their initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour . <sssss> it is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist . <sssss> it is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting . <sssss> it's a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out . <sssss> fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people . <sssss> in the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it . <sssss> i'll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don't spring up here and there , and i'll be even more amazed if fincher isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone . <sssss> they needn't bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher's elaborate attempt at a joke . <sssss> tyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization . <sssss> in this context , <POS> the joke works </POS> , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won't . <sssss> hopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won't spoil the joke for the rest of us . <sssss>

1 || i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . <sssss> i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire " wag the dog , " but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . <sssss> quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn't do that . <sssss> they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn't quite do that either . <sssss> a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick's " dr . <sssss> strangelove " in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn't do that . <sssss> that said , " wag the dog " is actually <POS> a very clever satire </POS> on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . <sssss> the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . <sssss> the accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . <sssss> brean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . <sssss> s . <sssss> is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . <sssss> as i said , " wag the dog " is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but <POS> there are some genuinely funny moments </POS> to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? <sssss> , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform " we have the right to fight for democracy . " <sssss> another scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . <sssss> <POS> the most consistently effective gag </POS> revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . <sssss> william " old shoe " schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . <sssss> of course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what's going on and strikes a deal with the president's electoral opponent to report to the media that the " fighting " has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . <sssss> still , even with the cia's involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . <sssss> regardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn't the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? <sssss> the film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . <sssss> schumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . <sssss> there was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss's forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . <sssss> with these plot holes , " wag the dog " doesn't quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . <sssss> brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . <sssss> the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . <sssss> motss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . <sssss> in fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss's increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . <sssss> i think it's fair to say that " wag the dog " underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . <sssss> still , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . <sssss> wag the dog <POS> takes the issue one step further </POS> and asks , what if the war wasn't even real ? <sssss> with this premise and the talented cast , the film <POS> still delivers more consistently than most </POS> , whatever its flaws . <sssss> 
1 || the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible . <sssss> people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred . <sssss> five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg's survivors of the shoah visual history foundation . <sssss> the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry . <sssss> as the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe . <sssss> in 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany's reach , and they became the last target of hitler's " final solution . " <sssss> each of the five tells his or her story . <sssss> their stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary . <sssss> they recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to " work " camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps . <sssss> they recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope . <sssss> each recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation . <sssss> and finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps . <sssss> needless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining . <sssss> by themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five . <sssss> the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage . <sssss> in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration . <sssss> the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days . <sssss> it's not clear which scene it is . <sssss> it could be one of two that i hadn't seen before , <POS> both powerful </POS> . <sssss> one is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars . <sssss> there is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white . <sssss> another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore . <sssss> there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say . <sssss> but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , <POS> in greater detail </POS> . <sssss> and i'm glad he did because <POS> his careful filmmaking stands up well </POS> compared to other movies on the same subject . <sssss> the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful . <sssss> x-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green . <sssss> also , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) <sssss> , so the richness and detail are impeccable . <sssss> the dvd's features are plentiful and well-chosen . <sssss> there is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter . <sssss> there are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors . <sssss> also , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side . <sssss> one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) . <sssss> you'd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they're not bloopers . <sssss> instead , <POS> they are solid , moving segments </POS> that were probably cut from the film only for length . <sssss> one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film . <sssss> renee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . <sssss> hans m ? <sssss> nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz . <sssss> firestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought . <sssss> the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable . <sssss> another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz . <sssss> he ends his prayer by saying " . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> forgive me for surviving .

1 || i know that " funnest " isn't a word . " <sssss> fun " is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . <sssss> but that's the word that came to me right after viewing " chicken run . " <sssss> no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like " that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! " <sssss> so to hell with webster's -- " chicken run " is <POS> one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while </POS> . <sssss> i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner . <sssss> the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something . <sssss> living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . <sssss> one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . <sssss> rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . <sssss> tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . <sssss> she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , " chickens go in ; pies come out . " <sssss> what sort of pies ? <sssss> chicken pies , of course . <sssss> co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : " creature comforts , " " the wrong trousers , " and " a close shave . " <sssss> the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . <sssss> part of what made the " wallace " films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . " <sssss> the wrong trousers , " for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and " a close shave " owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . <sssss> but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . <sssss> now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in " chicken run . " <sssss> the plot is largely lifted from " the great escape " ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . <sssss> thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; " chicken run " <POS> feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done </POS> . <sssss> part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? <sssss> park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . <sssss> but they're * chickens * , so <POS> it's funny to us </POS> . <sssss> another thing that helps " chicken run " ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing . <sssss> there are references to " the great escape , " obviously , and " stalag 17 . " <sssss> the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both " raiders of the lost ark " and " indiana jones and the temple of doom . " <sssss> there's even a nod to " the blues brothers , " if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history . <sssss> the " braveheart " reference <POS> is a hoot </POS> if you catch it . <sssss> when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , " chicken run " <POS> is downright brilliant in its execution </POS> . <sssss> consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of " blair witch project " parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . <sssss> out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . <sssss> why ? <sssss> because once you got past the thought that " they're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch' movie , " most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . <sssss> they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . <sssss> conversely , " chicken run " doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . <sssss> if you've never seen " indiana jones , " <POS> the chase sequence is still fun </POS> . <sssss> even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky <POS> remains an interesting character </POS> . <sssss> park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , " chicken run " is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . <sssss> enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , " chicken run " is that much richer . <sssss> the voice cast <POS> turns in uniformly lively performances </POS> , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them . <sssss> ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on " absolutely fabulous " ) nails it . <sssss> she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . <sssss> the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet . <sssss> poor mr . <sssss> tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help . <sssss> jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . <sssss> they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . <sssss> egg dilemma . <sssss> one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of " chicken run , " <POS> it comes as a delightful surprise </POS> . <sssss> the film <POS> manages to cross all barriers </POS> ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . <sssss> <POS> the animation is first-rate </POS> . <sssss> remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how <POS> truly remarkable </POS> " chicken run " really is . <sssss> this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : <POS> precise and unwavering attention to detail </POS> . <sssss> as in such top-notch family fare as " a bug's life " or " toy story 2 , " " chicken run " <POS> has something to offer in nearly every frame </POS> . <sssss> certainly a passive viewer <POS> can enjoy it </POS> as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers <POS> will enjoy it </POS> even more because they'll catch all the details . <sssss> anyway , the movie's just <POS> a boatload of fun </POS> . <sssss> <POS> funnest damn movie i've seen all year </POS> . <sssss> 
1 || capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . <sssss> joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . <sssss> it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) <sssss> and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . <sssss> the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . <sssss> <POS> i had a good time </POS> . <sssss> , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) here goes my credibility . <sssss> this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . <sssss> i liked the third jurassic park film . <sssss> i even liked the second jurassic park film . <sssss> in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . <sssss> jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , " for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy . " <sssss> that is what all the jurassic park films are . <sssss> expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house . <sssss> the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also . <sssss> jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs . <sssss> the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . <sssss> some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds . <sssss> that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . <sssss> <POS> i feel i got my money's worth </POS> . <sssss> the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica . <sssss> this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park . <sssss> they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height . <sssss> the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not . <sssss> the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . <sssss> flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . <sssss> he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . <sssss> but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . <sssss> doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . <sssss> macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . <sssss> they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . <sssss> he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . <sssss> right . <sssss> guess what happens next ? <sssss> jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . <sssss> first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . <sssss> sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . <sssss> curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . <sssss> one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . <sssss> they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films . <sssss> of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . <sssss> not only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . <sssss> in this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . <sssss> this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . <sssss> each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . <sssss> in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . <sssss> it has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . <sssss> perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . <sssss> sometimes they just move too fast to see . <sssss> occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . <sssss> a few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . <sssss> but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . <sssss> the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film . <sssss> joe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . <sssss> a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . <sssss> the film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but <POS> it still is fun </POS> . <sssss> if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , <POS> the film is for you </POS> . <sssss> i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . <sssss> 
1 || just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . <sssss> either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet <POS> it remains consistently funny </POS> . <sssss> why is this ? <sssss> maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . <sssss> director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , <POS> has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself </POS> and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . <sssss> when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . <sssss> i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . <sssss> i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . <sssss> and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . <sssss> rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . <sssss> he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . <sssss> and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . <sssss> he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . <sssss> whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . <sssss> grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . <sssss> rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . <sssss> during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . <sssss> but these aren't any girlfriends ? <sssss> these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . <sssss> the plot in three words is : women and music . <sssss> the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera <POS> is very effective </POS> . <sssss> it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . <sssss> it also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . <sssss> jack black <POS> steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance </POS> as a total sleaze ball . <sssss> just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . <sssss> what frears <POS> does so well </POS> is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . <sssss> john cusack plays his character <POS> convincingly </POS> but it is <POS> the strong supporting cast </POS> , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . <sssss> now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . <sssss> the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . <sssss> instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . <sssss> also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . <sssss> high fidelity <POS> is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs </POS> . <sssss> i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . <sssss>

1 || in brief : <POS> best bleak comedy film </POS> since heathers . <sssss> <POS> full of wonderful swipes </POS> at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture . <sssss> <POS> go see it ! <sssss> </POS> so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on " hard copy " with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's . " <sssss> hard copy " 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for . <sssss> smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal . <sssss> ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) <sssss> smart's got a point . <sssss> it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . <sssss> however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . <sssss> real murderers rarely <POS> have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written </POS> for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . <sssss> to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . <sssss> the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . ' <sssss> of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . <sssss> but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily . <sssss> kidman <POS> triumphs in the trashy role </POS> of suzanne . <sssss> i have never really been all that fond of this actress but <POS> she shows a wonderful flair for comedy </POS> in this picture . <sssss> her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . <sssss> kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell . <sssss> she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman <POS> delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way </POS> . <sssss> at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law . " <sssss> you know , " she knowingly exclaims , " gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . " <sssss> her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . <sssss> <POS> this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks </POS> . <sssss> the <POS> other standout performance </POS> in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . <sssss> he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors . <sssss> kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . <sssss> phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . <sssss> his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever . <sssss> phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . <sssss> gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) <POS> direction is first-rate </POS> . <sssss> he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along . <sssss> van sant <POS> rightly keeps the focus </POS> of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . <sssss> van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story . <sssss> the screenplay , by buck henry , <POS> is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard </POS> since heathers . <sssss> henry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . <sssss> henry <POS> ably manages to avoid diluting his story </POS> by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic . <sssss> danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands . <sssss> either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties . <sssss> all-in-all , <POS> a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks ! <sssss> </POS> to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant . <sssss> written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard . <sssss> rated r - for language and mature themes . <sssss> ( respect the r , not for under 14's ) rating ----- stars . <sssss> <POS> go see it </POS> . <sssss>

" <sssss> fail-safe " takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism . <sssss> the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws . <sssss> five u . <sssss> s . <sssss> bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america . <sssss> the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers . <sssss> suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike . <sssss> a great deal of " fail-safe " 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . <sssss> s . <sssss> bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost . <sssss> <POS> the plot is compelling </POS> , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios . <sssss> the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails . <sssss> general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable . <sssss> the events in " fail-safe " are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason " fail-safe " works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot . <sssss> a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it . <sssss> most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war . <sssss> many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices . <sssss> early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of " strategy " in a nuclear assault to " minimize " casualties . " <sssss> what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? " <sssss> a guest asks impatiently . " <sssss> forty million , " groeteschele responds wryly . <sssss> the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . <sssss> the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . <sssss> groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . <sssss> yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended . <sssss> on the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . <sssss> s . <sssss> , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . <sssss> such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . " <sssss> fail-safe " clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . <sssss> why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? <sssss> is it wise ? <sssss> is it even logical ? <sssss> no , not really . <sssss> although " fail-safe " is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . <sssss> again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . <sssss> in addition to providing the central " pro-nuclear war " voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . <sssss> the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . <sssss> one of groeteschele's " logical " trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd . <sssss> he labels the average marxist an " unfeeling , calculating machine " that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . <sssss> groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . <sssss> s . <sssss> drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . <sssss> groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . <sssss> the irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing . <sssss> he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . <sssss> once the film makes it evident that turning the u . <sssss> s . <sssss> bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . <sssss> just how will the soviet union's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? <sssss> ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) <sssss> with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . <sssss> without getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . <sssss> ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear " incident " can probably be . ) <sssss> it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real consequences . <sssss> dramatically , <POS> the ending is quite powerful </POS> , and the use of o'herlihy's character as the symbolic " matador " ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film's opening ) , is <POS> particularly appropriate </POS> . " <sssss> fail-safe " is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . <sssss> nevertheless , under lumet's direction and walter bernstein's intelligent adaptation of burdick's and wheeler's novel , the film <POS> continues to have a lasting effect </POS> even after the events on screen have unfolded . <sssss> the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . <sssss> but it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that " fail-safe " also finds dangerous . <sssss> in retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . <sssss> it's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown . <sssss> 
1 || andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . <sssss> webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as " oklahoma ! <sssss> , " or the slapstickness of shows like " a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . " <sssss> they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . <sssss> like " jesus christ superstar , " which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune " superstar , " a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , " evita " takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? <sssss> n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . " <sssss> evita " deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? <sssss> n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to " the top " ) . <sssss> webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . <sssss> here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . <sssss> it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . <sssss> the film plays like a rock opera , much like their " jesus christ superstar , " with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only <POS> an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one </POS> . <sssss> after all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this . <sssss> they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . <sssss> this is why the beginning of " evita " is kind of a let-down . <sssss> okay , it is a let-down . <sssss> i'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good . <sssss> but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand . <sssss> in the musical , <POS> it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper </POS> , " buenos aires , " which is also lifeless . <sssss> then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , " another suitcase in another hall , " which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . <sssss> the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . <sssss> for a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off . <sssss> however , <POS> the film pulls itself together in a flash </POS> , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song " goodbye and thank you , " where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . <sssss> from this point on , <POS> the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical </POS> . <sssss> no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . <sssss> we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . <sssss> more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work . <sssss> juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . <sssss> a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . <sssss> >from the " goodbye and thank you " number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden . <sssss> but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . <sssss> that's when our narrator , ch ? <sssss> , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . <sssss> describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? <sssss> guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . <sssss> alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he's done " fame , " " the committments , " " bugsy malone , " and " pink floyd the wall " - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , <POS> nails the film </POS> , exposing everything for what it is . <sssss> we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . <sssss> his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . <sssss> and <POS> there is energy throughout </POS> , with lots of bright colors , and scenes <POS> which are cinematically entertaning </POS> , as well as <POS> enriching and deep </POS> , such as the balcony scene where she sings " don't cry for me , argentina , " and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . <sssss> madonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . <sssss> at the beginning , she looks like she's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . <sssss> <POS> her death , though , is brilliant </POS> . <sssss> her singing could be better though . <sssss> i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she's trying to hard . <sssss> she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> patti lupone - i heard her sing on an old " evita " cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . <sssss> but <POS> it's generally very good </POS> , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . <sssss> antonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i'm one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is <POS> extremely comanding in his performance </POS> , presenting a lovable narrator . <sssss> his singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . <sssss> <POS> he does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range </POS> . <sssss> and jonathan pryce <POS> is pretty awesome </POS> , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . <sssss> although it gets off to a rocky start ( " rocky " 's polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . <sssss> like the other musical released in '96 ( woody allen's " everyone says i love you " ) , it's a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance . <sssss> 
1 || there's more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . <sssss> in how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . <sssss> all the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . <sssss> motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . <sssss> the " quilting bee " consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma's husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna's daughter . <sssss> the project they're busy with is the wedding quilt for hy's granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . <sssss> she's spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it's better to marry a friend or a lover . <sssss> one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching <POS> an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast </POS> . <sssss> from winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , <POS> this film is overflowing with realized talent </POS> . <sssss> <POS> the performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up </POS> many of the script's weaknesses . <sssss> how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . <sssss> there are probably too many characters . <sssss> so , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . <sssss> we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . <sssss> there are other episodes as well : the love of anna's life , marianna's soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend's husband . <sssss> the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn's story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . <sssss> there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . <sssss> <POS> the stories are all well-told </POS> , but it's difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . <sssss> while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . <sssss> there isn't enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . <sssss> to put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn't " do much " for me . <sssss> on the whole , how to make an american quilt is <POS> a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say </POS> about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . <sssss> finn's segment is by far the most compelling , because she's the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else's experiences . <sssss> the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . <sssss> if there's a disappointment here , it's that the script doesn't have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing <POS> such a fine cast in top form </POS> allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional . <sssss>

1 || i have to say it . <sssss> tim burton's retelling of planet of the apes <POS> is more fun than a barrel of monkeys </POS> . <sssss> ok , that's off my chest . <sssss> no more monkey puns , i promise . <sssss> seriously , though , planet of the apes is <POS> one rip-roarin' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny </POS> ( dare i say , monkey ) business . <sssss> i know , i know , i promised . <sssss> and for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie . <sssss> mark wahlberg stars as capt . <sssss> leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future . <sssss> he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery . <sssss> despite being darker than the original , burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious . <sssss> some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed . <sssss> then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter . <sssss> the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : " one thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager , " he says . <sssss> you don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement . <sssss> touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton's brand . <sssss> lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are : " take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human .

1 || urban legend surprised me . <sssss> based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena . <sssss> thankfully , legend <POS> rose above it's soggy premise </POS> to become not only a hip , scary and <POS> stylish entertainment </POS> , but also what will probably become one of <POS> the best films of the year </POS> . <sssss> you're all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody's favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> the only person you didn't suspect ! <sssss> however , just because legend doesn't really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can't qualify as first-class entertainment . <sssss> it was , believe it or not , <POS> one of the funnest times i've had </POS> at the movies all year . <sssss> the thing is , i'm not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive . <sssss> maybe it was <POS> the above-par performances </POS> by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and " cybil " actress alicia witt ) . <sssss> or , it could have been the <POS> on- target direction </POS> by jamie blanks . <sssss> more likely , though , it was because of <POS> the inspired premise </POS> . <sssss> i don't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman . <sssss> urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film . <sssss> a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) <sssss> a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill . <sssss> one problem , though . <sssss> would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ? <sssss> i thought not . <sssss> predictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company . <sssss> it's odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody's on the other line . <sssss> naturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off . <sssss> and the when we least expect it . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> whack ! <sssss> ! <sssss> ! <sssss> a decapitation . <sssss> it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car . <sssss> so who is it this time ? <sssss> the obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends . <sssss> a-ha . <sssss> or could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ? <sssss> like all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit . <sssss> and it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn't suspect . <sssss> i'm not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but <POS> i must give credit where credit is due </POS> . <sssss> and this flick <POS> definitely deserves credit </POS> for being what not many other recent horror films have been . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> fun . <sssss> * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca <sssss> 
1 || capsule : the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi-day festivities . <sssss> mira nair's film is pleasant enough with a little human drama , a few family secrets , some sadness and some happiness . <sssss> you have seen it all before , but perhaps not from india . <sssss> <POS> the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable </POS> . <sssss> , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala . <sssss> her newest film , written by sabrina dhawan , is very similar to previous films like betsy's wedding but it is set in new delhi . <sssss> a wealthy family is having a wedding . <sssss> an indian wedding is a multi-day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial . <sssss> even more than in the us , it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get-together . <sssss> the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members' individual story lines . <sssss> aditi verma is marrying hemant , an indian engineer working in the us . <sssss> she had previously had a relationship with vikram , her supervisor . <sssss> latit , her father ( played by naseeruddin shah ) , is juggling many problems , not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey . <sssss> dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration . <sssss> even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice , one of the family servants . <sssss> several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex , family secrets , or both . <sssss> there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love . <sssss> some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films . <sssss> western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna . <sssss> on the other hand it was not clear ( to me at least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films . <sssss> this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english . <sssss> the latter will , however , help with an international release . <sssss> sabrina dhawan's screenplay is <POS> vibrant with witty dialog </POS> . <sssss> we have seen films with plotting very much like this , but the indian setting <POS> makes a great deal of difference </POS> . <sssss> director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life . <sssss> i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . <sssss>

1 || no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , " jude the obscure , " his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . <sssss> but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . " <sssss> jude " is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but <POS> what's remarkable is how timeless this film is </POS> . <sssss> the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it'd be kinda different ( a given ) . <sssss> it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from " shallow grave " ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams . <sssss> in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . <sssss> after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life . <sssss> taking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself . <sssss> but when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . <sssss> another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . <sssss> she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . <sssss> several twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . <sssss> . <sssss> . ) <sssss> , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile . <sssss> because they aren't married , and because they're cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on . <sssss> if you didn't think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . <sssss> he will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . <sssss> part of it is his fault - he's too optimistic , and too gullible . <sssss> but society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death . <sssss> the ending of " jude " is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i'll have to read it now ) . " <sssss> jude " offers a satirical view on society's cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn't . <sssss> there's no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . <sssss> satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people's minds , and that's what " jude " is . <sssss> sure , it's one hell of a downer , but it needs to be . <sssss> the film also <POS> posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads </POS> , and <POS> some good supporting work </POS> along with it . <sssss> christopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) <POS> plays jude wonderfully </POS> , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times . <sssss> kate winslet , in a pre- " titanic " performance , is <POS> brilliant </POS> , <POS> nailing every psyche of her character </POS> , and creating someone who's troubled but very seductive with her personality . <sssss> kate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don't believe me , see " titanic , " branagh's " hamlet , " " sense and sensibility , " and " heavenly creatures , " the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . <sssss> in the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude's wife , whom he never divorces . " <sssss> jude " moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . <sssss> but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) <POS> will appreciate </POS> " jude , " though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it . <sssss>

<sssss> yup . <sssss> deniro and hoffman are " stealing " the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) <sssss> wag the dog succeeds because it's based one great truth : the american people are stupid . <sssss> ok , maybe it's not " love thy neighbor as thyself " or even " two plus two makes four " , but a truth nonetheless . <sssss> ( any average person who thinks that they're really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) <sssss> and because we're so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won't notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro's character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won't be able to locate albania on the map . <sssss> the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn't a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . <sssss> nor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . <sssss> instead , david mamet's script <POS> strikes that delicate balance </POS> between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . <sssss> it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . <sssss> deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . <sssss> it's all : " what do i love ? <sssss> what is it that brings me joy ? <sssss> baseball , " minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . <sssss> he threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he's doing it in a very nice , polite way . <sssss> it's a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . <sssss> hoffman , on the other hand , is <POS> giddy , exuberant and joyous </POS> . <sssss> this kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he's so excited that he can't even shut up . <sssss> even on the edge of disaster , he's bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . <sssss> insiders note that he's basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . <sssss> the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . <sssss> the characters are so well drawn and <POS> so well acted </POS> that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don't . <sssss> anne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . <sssss> denis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the " fad king " , who handles the profitable " back-end " -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . <sssss> they could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i'd go see it . <sssss> willie nelson and merle haggard <POS> handle the musical end of things fabulously </POS> , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious " ballad of the green berets " parody . <sssss> woody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated " hero " of the albanian conflict . <sssss> craig t . <sssss> nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . <sssss> macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . <sssss> ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) <sssss> wag the dog is <POS> a funny movie </POS> about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . <sssss> we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . <sssss> wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don't . <sssss>

1 || the second jackal-based film to come out in 1997 ( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal ) , this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland , and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo's own alma matter , concordia university in montreal , canada . <sssss> the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal , but does not pretend to be 100% factual . <sssss> plot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal , in order to put an end to the actual militant's radical activities . <sssss> he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee . <sssss> ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this " assignment " , and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism , intrigue and double-personality syndrome ( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states . ) <sssss> critique : <POS> great premise is executed with enough style </POS> and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime . <sssss> admittedly , i wasn't a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film , and didn't expect much from this movie beforehand , but <POS> surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments </POS> , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line . <sssss> the first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come , and does offer a great characterization of the jackal , but the second hour is the one that <POS> really cranks in the cool scenes </POS> and a sweet ending . <sssss> quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal , but didn't offer anything extraordinary , in my opinion . <sssss> sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they've played in both of their respective careers of late , but nonetheless , appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters . <sssss> i didn't like performance put forth from quinn's wife in this flick , but then again , she doesn't show up in most of the film , so that wasn't so bad . <sssss> <POS> i did however enjoy director duguay's interesting style and cinematic vision </POS> . <sssss> this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences , but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer . <sssss> <POS> i thought that was neat </POS> . <sssss> having said that , i didn't think the first hour needed to be as long as it was , and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the " fake " jackal met with the " real " jackal's girlfriend without much retrospection on her part , but all in all , not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre . <sssss> little known facts : ben kingsley's real name is krishna banji , he stands 5 " 8 , was born in scarborough , england , and won the best actor honor in 1982's academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi . <sssss> many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal , canada ( joblo's haven of restfulness ) . <sssss> donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland , is canadian , and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal . <sssss>

1 || the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : " it mu5t be found . " <sssss> so what , exactly , is the fifth element ? <sssss> after seeing luc besson's ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . <sssss> but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , <POS> a wildly imaginative feast </POS> for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . <sssss> the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . <sssss> speaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it . <sssss> figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson's the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . <sssss> all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . <sssss> what remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . <sssss> <POS> the look is absolutely mesmerizing </POS> right from the opening moments to the last . <sssss> the frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , <POS> is absolutely breathtaking to behold </POS> , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . <sssss> but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren't equally as interesting , and are they ever . <sssss> in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna's pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . <sssss> gaulthier's outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson's futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . <sssss> while besson's <POS> bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film </POS> , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . <sssss> for all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . <sssss> i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . <sssss> at first this character's hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . <sssss> not irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . <sssss> the tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra's innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . <sssss> then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . <sssss> the story's weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . <sssss> while <POS> still visually and aurally spectacular </POS> , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . <sssss> the big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . <sssss> as such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . <sssss> this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the " enemy " --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . <sssss> shadow--is still waiting to be made . <sssss> still , despite the story problems , the fifth element is <POS> an artistic triumph </POS> for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker's original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory . <sssss> <POS> it is a fascinating example </POS> of how of one artist's fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams . <sssss>

" <sssss> the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . <sssss> you honestly don't need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . <sssss> the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . <sssss> and yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , " pretty woman " is <POS> an astoundingly charming </POS> motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became <POS> such an overnight sensation </POS> with moviegoers . <sssss> you'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i've seen on film in the 1990's . <sssss> additionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . <sssss> playing sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as " american gigolo " and " an officer and a gentleman , " gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . <sssss> julia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received " mistic pizza " and 1989's " steel magnolia , " for which she was nominated for an academy award , <POS> is radiant and funny </POS> as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . <sssss> it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . <sssss> f . <sssss> lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . <sssss> after " pretty woman , " roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released " runaway bride , " which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . <sssss> roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can <POS> efficiently do drama </POS> , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . <sssss> an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . <sssss> no only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . <sssss> on the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel's lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . <sssss> another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . " <sssss> pretty woman " does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you'd expect , and wouldn't have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . <sssss> this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because <POS> there is just far too much magic </POS> at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . <sssss> helped along by <POS> a warm , memorable supporting performance </POS> from laura san giacomo , as vivian's best friend and roommate , and <POS> a fabulously catchy soundtrack </POS> , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie's overall fulfillment , " pretty woman " is <POS> a sparkler of a motion picture </POS> , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make <POS> the quintessential romantic comedy </POS> . <sssss>

1 || seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p . <sssss> m . <sssss> at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . <sssss> y . ) <sssss> , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8 . <sssss> 50 . <sssss> [theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface . <sssss> i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . ) <sssss> as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? <sssss> never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old . <sssss> never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released . <sssss> never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything . <sssss> and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader . <sssss> before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) . <sssss> as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) . <sssss> george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically . <sssss> in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons . <sssss> with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> second trilogy . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> well you know what i mean ) . <sssss> and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution . <sssss> [critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule . <sssss> critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . ' <sssss> because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] <sssss> first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . <sssss> we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . <sssss> we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . ' <sssss> we also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . <sssss> what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . <sssss> to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . <sssss> also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . <sssss> most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . <sssss> for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . <sssss> with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights . <sssss> unfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . <sssss> i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . <sssss> if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) <sssss> . <sssss> but i digress . <sssss> i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . <sssss> all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . <sssss> what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . <sssss> its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . <sssss> the basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . <sssss> we're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . <sssss> we're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . <sssss> we're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . <sssss> the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . <sssss> the leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . <sssss> he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . <sssss> sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . <sssss> clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . <sssss> i have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) . <sssss> but it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along . <sssss> the film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . <sssss> there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . <sssss> the other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . <sssss> the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . <sssss> as we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . <sssss> and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . <sssss> to briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . <sssss> their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . <sssss> jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . <sssss> this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . <sssss> in fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . <sssss> the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . <sssss> by the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . <sssss> it's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . <sssss> not that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . <sssss> and at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . <sssss> it does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . <sssss> `the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why <POS> it succeeds as well as it does </POS> but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . <sssss> so many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . <sssss> but <POS> this film is far from bad </POS> because it at least <POS> embraces the spirit of sheer fun </POS> at the movies . <sssss>

1 || near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . <sssss> the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . <sssss> at best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . <sssss> in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . <sssss> there have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , <POS> a new champion has emerged </POS> . <sssss> dreamworks' the prince of egypt <POS> succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed </POS> . <sssss> the other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . <sssss> although camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . <sssss> unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . <sssss> in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and <POS> created a genuinely unique product </POS> . <sssss> <POS> the animation is flawless </POS> , and , aside from a bug's life , is <POS> the best-looking movie to date </POS> . <sssss> the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . <sssss> the key to success , however , was that <POS> the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot </POS> . <sssss> namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . <sssss> dreamworks is the first studio to prove that <POS> they've got the stuff of success </POS> , and that they're capable of challenging disney . <sssss> <POS> the story is also well-written </POS> , and the characters <POS> voiced with talent </POS> . <sssss> for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . <sssss> the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . <sssss> in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . <sssss> moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family . <sssss> moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . <sssss> by this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . <sssss> <POS> the cast of voices is most impressive </POS> , and also includes such <POS> noteables </POS> as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . <sssss> the script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall <POS> the story is exciting and interesting </POS> . <sssss> it's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . <sssss> but for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt <POS> can be a great watch </POS> . <sssss>

1 || jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . <sssss> in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin

you-know-where . <sssss> he's mean . <sssss> i mean really mean . <sssss> the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . <sssss> every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . <sssss> you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . <sssss> one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . <sssss> at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . <sssss> another person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor . <sssss> aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . <sssss> simon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) <sssss> , also gay , does not fare much better . <sssss> when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces . <sssss> this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . <sssss> an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him . <sssss> it doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . <sssss> <POS> one of the best elements </POS> of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . <sssss> he's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . <sssss> <POS> good performances are turned in by all principal players </POS> in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . <sssss> <POS> they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen </POS> . <sssss> greg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , <POS> is also very good </POS> at playing the vulnerable simon . <sssss> he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and <POS> delivers it with such inspiration and conviction </POS> that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . <sssss> cuba gooding jr . <sssss> performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . <sssss> the screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . <sssss> brooks , <POS> is clever , touching , and funny </POS> . <sssss> the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because <POS> they are actually

trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . <sssss> simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . <sssss> <POS> combined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film </POS> . <sssss> the one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . <sssss> through the second half . <sssss> his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . <sssss> i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion . <sssss> there's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention . <sssss> this is that little dog . <sssss> <POS> he plays such a pivotal role </POS> to

1 || synopsis : committed to an asylum , the marquis de sade ( rush ) continues to publish pornographic literature , aided by young maid madeleine ( winslet ) . <sssss> abbe coulmier ( phoenix ) , who runs the hospital , disapproves of the stories , but humours him in the hope of achieving a cure . <sssss> de sade's craft and life are threatened when the emperor dispatches dr royer-collard ( michael caine ) to stop the marquis' work , permanently . <sssss> review : " quills " is an exploration of the marquis de sade : his madness , his cruelty and his perversion , his obsession with sex in any form , no matter how obscene . <sssss> but " quills " also details the marquis' determination : to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path , and to propagate his words to the masses . <sssss> the extent to which de sade is willing to go to practise his trade is <POS> amongst the movie's most intriguing elements </POS> , as when de sade scribes a story in his own blood , or narrates a tale via of a chain of fellow inmates , cell to cell . <sssss> to provide a contrast with the marquis , wright involves him with two very different characters . <sssss> one is the abbe , a handsome , charming and kindly man whose desires are stymied by his oath to god . <sssss> the abbe lusts for madeleine , but it is the wizened marquis who is able to have her . <sssss> and then there is royer-collard , a hypocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the marquis' motley creations . <sssss> rush is <POS> splendid </POS> as de sade , <POS> utterly inhabiting the character </POS> . <sssss> kaufman's direction is fine , and he is able to bring a sense of bizarre humour to the grim proceedings . <sssss> the plot itself is rather mundane and plays out unsurprisingly , but this is virtually unimportant . <sssss> for two hours , " quills " acquaints us with the marquis de sade -- and , more frightening still , allows us brief insight into his scatological soul . <sssss> 
1 || with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous " ellen " sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . <sssss> the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . <sssss> then along came in & out , and all three of these films <POS> are on my top ten list </POS> for the years in which they were released . <sssss> it's also noticeable that this " alternative lifestyle " becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . <sssss> while it's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . <sssss> but the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . <sssss> while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . <sssss> it doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . <sssss> the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . <sssss> if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . <sssss> it's a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . <sssss> it's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . <sssss> kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . <sssss> after a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . <sssss> the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . <sssss> when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . <sssss> brackett . <sssss> everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , " and he's gay . " <sssss> the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . <sssss> the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . <sssss> naturally the questions pour from howard's fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school's principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . <sssss> the frenzy isn't helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and " entertainment tonight " wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . <sssss> one particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of " inside entertainment " , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . <sssss> the intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . <sssss> it seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . <sssss> the dominoes begin to tumble as howard's closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . <sssss> it all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren't <POS> presented with near-perfection by one of this year's most delightful ensemble casts </POS> . <sssss> kline seems only to improve with age , and <POS> he is downright perfect </POS> here . <sssss> <POS> the great thing about this film </POS> is that every single character has a moment to shine , and <POS> they use it wonderfully </POS> . <sssss> every single actor turns in <POS> one of their best performances ever </POS> . <sssss> dillon <POS> has never been so likeable </POS> , cusack <POS> has never seemed so perfect for a role </POS> , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart <POS> all provide huge laughs </POS> when they're up to bat . <sssss> rudnick's script is heavily <POS> laced with wit and humor </POS> , and you'll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . <sssss> while in & out doesn't carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around . <sssss> <POS> the script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we're allowed just the perfect blend </POS> of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . <sssss> it remains <POS> a solid comedy </POS> throughout its entirety , yet we're still allowed a sappily touching ending . <sssss> despite it's subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . <sssss> frank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , <POS> directs this film quite delightfully </POS> , using all the potential rudnick's script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . <sssss> <POS> check this one out </POS> . <sssss> you'll have a gay old time . <sssss> 
1 || with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks <POS> has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there </POS> , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different . <sssss> its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . <sssss> the parallels don't end there , either . <sssss> atlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher . <sssss> even the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile . <sssss> in fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . <sssss> king's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter ) . <sssss> it's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . <sssss> bobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . <sssss> when a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . <sssss> ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . <sssss> i won't go into what these powers are , but they're considerably toned down from the book ( and don't involve black stuff flying out of ted's mouth , a la mile ) . <sssss> atlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . <sssss> atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski's red . <sssss> <POS> the acting is solid </POS> from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . <sssss> lecter . <sssss> <POS> most impressive are youngsters </POS> yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . <sssss> while i didn't really have much of a problem with goldman's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . <sssss> goldman , for those of you who don't read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's penned ( like the general's daughter ) . <sssss> it's mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . <sssss> j . <sssss> and robert blake ) . <sssss> in atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . <sssss> well , he's not , and it doesn't make sense . <sssss> 1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements <sssss>

1 || note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . <sssss> be forewarned . <sssss> on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . <sssss> although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming <POS> one of the most successful films </POS> of its type in history , while <POS> delighting audiences </POS> by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . <sssss> the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . <sssss> the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . <sssss> scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . <sssss> and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . <sssss> it's hard to understate this last point . <sssss> mr . <sssss> williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . <sssss> indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . <sssss> williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional " a film by wes craven " drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads " written by kevin williamson " , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . <sssss> ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of " a film by " is attained . ) <sssss> and , much like mr . <sssss> tarantino's screenwriting , mr . <sssss> williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . <sssss> in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . <sssss> scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . <sssss> williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . <sssss> while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . <sssss> williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging . <sssss> like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the " true life " events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . <sssss> however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen ) . <sssss> there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . <sssss> flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . <sssss> the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . <sssss> they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . <sssss> the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? <sssss> there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . <sssss> buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) . <sssss> any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . <sssss> as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . <sssss> one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . <sssss> here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . <sssss> williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . <sssss> the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . <sssss> ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) <sssss> indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . <sssss> this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . <sssss> while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . <sssss> <POS> they're staged much more imaginatively here </POS> ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are <POS> much more fun to watch </POS> . <sssss> it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . <sssss> in terms of its characters , <POS> the strong part of the film </POS> is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . <sssss> their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . <sssss> on the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . <sssss> she doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine . <sssss> given this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . <sssss> what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . <sssss> the film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . <sssss> ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious . ) <sssss> but hey , as rose mcgowan's character said in the first film : " no , please don't kill me , mr . <sssss> ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! " <sssss> look what that got her . <sssss> 
1 || note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . <sssss> be forewarned . <sssss> it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . <sssss> the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast . <sssss> since then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent . <sssss> with the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which <POS> sparked the modern revival of feature animation </POS> , the little mermaid . <sssss> while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , <POS> unquestionably top-notch </POS> , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but <POS> the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music </POS> . <sssss> the film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince . <sssss> what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions . <sssss> from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she's resolutely smitten , and she's such a pure and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart with her . <sssss> this simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid <POS> a remarkably captivating picture </POS> . <sssss> one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters . <sssss> this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities . <sssss> while it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy . <sssss> do we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? <sssss> is the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? <sssss> ( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ) <sssss> fortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , <POS> are impeccably cast </POS> . <sssss> chief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who <POS> voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection </POS> ; with a <POS> wonderfully expressive speaking </POS> voice full of youthful vigor , and <POS> gorgeous singing voice </POS> , ms . <sssss> benson provides <POS> a most engaging anchor </POS> for the film . <sssss> ( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber . ) <sssss> similarly , samuel e . <sssss> wright <POS> is terrific </POS> in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab . <sssss> he easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid's big tunes -- " under the sea " and " kiss the girl " -- <POS> have become the stuff of legend </POS> . <sssss> pat carrol is <POS> deliciously villainous and vampy </POS> as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars' <POS> booming voice </POS> conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel's father , king triton . <sssss> in large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is <POS> impeccably cast </POS> . <sssss> of course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its <POS> remarkable collection of songs </POS> composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . <sssss> ashman's untimely death . <sssss> not only are mr . <sssss> menken's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . <sssss> ashman's <POS> charming lyrics </POS> are fully integrated into the film's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue , and consequently <POS> work wonderfully within the context </POS> of the film . <sssss> mr . <sssss> menken's score for the film is <POS> equally top-notch </POS> ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . <sssss> menken's fine score . <sssss> it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled " under the sea " as joyfully crooned by mr . <sssss> wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . <sssss> benson's heartfelt rendition of the ballad " part of your world " , <POS> an achingly beautiful tune </POS> of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . <sssss> ashman ) which , accompanied by the film's <POS> most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes </POS> . <sssss> during the song's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is <POS> nothing short of breathtaking </POS> , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history . <sssss> as of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney's limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid . <sssss> there's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia . <sssss> in every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . <sssss> but although disney's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , <POS> the real winner is the public </POS> . <sssss> any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and <POS> it's a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen </POS> . <sssss> the little mermaid is <POS> the best film to come out </POS> of the disney's modern animation renaissance , and <POS> one of the greatest animated films ever made </POS> . <sssss> 
1 || this christmas , little ralphie parker ( peter billingsley ) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree . <sssss> although cautioned by many that he will ? <sssss> shoot his eye out' , ralphie remains optimistic , conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers . <sssss> it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun , and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one . <sssss> `a christmas story' is <POS> a favorite among many </POS> during the holiday season , and boy , <POS> it is certainly easy to see why </POS> . <sssss> ralphie's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood , when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable . <sssss> evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story' does so well . <sssss> here are a few features that make this film <POS> such a charming little package </POS> for everybody during the holiday season : 1 ) period detail . <sssss> this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard , who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940's with loving detail . <sssss> shepard narrates from a first person point-of-view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head . <sssss> shepard's first-hand commentary of several situations is not only <POS> downright hilarious </POS> , but also <POS> witty and warm </POS> , with various metaphorical meanings that <POS> ring perfectly </POS> with the essence of comic timing . <sssss> on top of that , young billingsley's stupefied reactions to each predicament is <POS> absolutely perfect </POS> in contrast with the narration . <sssss> director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era <POS> with wonderful technicality </POS> . <sssss> <POS> i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction </POS> of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like . <sssss> 2 ) mom and dad . <sssss> both melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? <sssss> the old man' ) are <POS> perfect in their roles </POS> . <sssss> it's hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured . <sssss> for instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues . <sssss> in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , peter billingsley <POS> has struck quite the chord </POS> . <sssss> his performance is richly textured , making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into <POS> radiate with flavor and enjoyment </POS> . <sssss> which brings us to . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> 3 ) the comic situations . <sssss> <POS> there are plenty of memorable moments </POS> in `a christmas story' . <sssss> moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing , with so much more to explore and to cherish . <sssss> i am particularly partial of the ? <sssss> f-word scene' , in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four-letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard . <sssss> again , shepard's method of handling this amusing scenario is <POS> nothing short of comic wizardry </POS> . <sssss> the numerous sequences that stick in one's mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree . <sssss> i could go on , but i'll finish on this note : `a christmas story' <POS> is a standout </POS> among holiday movies , because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes . <sssss> not only is it funny , <POS> it's often genuinely hilarious </POS> . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> not to mention <POS> warm , fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places </POS> . <sssss> i plan on making `a christmas story' a christmas tradition . <sssss> why don't you ? <sssss> 
1 || in intolerance , d . <sssss> w . <sssss> griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other . <sssss> each of the stories builds to a fast-paced

<sssss> what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized . <sssss> each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve . <sssss> while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene . <sssss> then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again . <sssss> it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . <sssss> this creates some strange effects . <sssss> the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . <sssss> the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content . <sssss> we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends . <sssss> phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal . <sssss> partridge's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason . <sssss> frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help

john c . <sssss> reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place . <sssss> jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h . <sssss> macy ) . <sssss> the film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story <POS> is resolved satisfactorily </POS> . <sssss> each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story . <sssss> the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . <sssss> the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event . <sssss> magnolia <POS> will probably bring some much deserved attention </POS> to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories . <sssss> it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson's company . <sssss> john c . <sssss> reilly seems to be a standard fixture . <sssss> particularly notable is philip baker hall who <POS> gave a mesmerizing performance </POS> from the first scene of hard eight . <sssss> here he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used . <sssss> as studies of characters these stories <POS> are each worth following </POS> . <sssss> as well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired . <sssss> but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through . <sssss> i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . <sssss> heavy spoiler . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> heavy spoiler . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> heavy spoiler . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> heavy spoiler . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen . <sssss> and in actual fact , it does . <sssss> since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods . <sssss> it is , however , a perfectly natural , if somewhat unnerving , phenomenon . <sssss> the cause is associated with whirlwinds . <sssss> we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air , holding them aloft . <sssss> the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister . <sssss> smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are . <sssss> when the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate . <sssss> essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere . <sssss> so while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in . <sssss> the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs . <sssss> it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped . <sssss> it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon . <sssss> ( frankly i have no idea on these points . ) <sssss> otherwise <POS> the event was quite believable </POS> . <sssss> what we see in this film <POS> is much more credible </POS> than the phenomena we saw in volcano . <sssss> in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 . " <sssss> and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . " <sssss> however a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not a biblical portent . <sssss> note that the previous verse says " and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> , " so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river . <sssss> the only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 : 13 . <sssss> 
1 || contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact . <sssss> four of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , <POS> it's a very impressive film </POS> . <sssss> the same can't be said for films like independance day , but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy . <sssss> contact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of " merely listening " to sounds out in space . <sssss> her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) . <sssss> while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive . <sssss> ellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young . <sssss> in puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as " a man of the cloth , without the cloth " . <sssss> despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a " supreme being " , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together . <sssss> it's a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on . <sssss> meanwhile , dr . <sssss> david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding . <sssss> this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember . <sssss> it is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science . <sssss> when the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at . <sssss> eventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) . <sssss> the media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn't get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) <sssss> . <sssss> as if that weren't enough , ellie's discovery leads her to the nation's capital where she again runs into palmer . <sssss> contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . <sssss> religion . <sssss> the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . <sssss> arguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . <sssss> when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . <sssss> the question is , can a person who doesn't believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ?

1 || roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton . <sssss> this italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , <POS> has done the near impossible </POS> by creating a comic fable about the holocaust . <sssss> but benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice . <sssss> the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore . <sssss> like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni's guido has a childlike innocence . <sssss> he ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government . <sssss> instead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official . <sssss> in benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter . <sssss> guido wins dora . <sssss> they marry . <sssss> fast forward about five years . <sssss> guido , dora , and their 5-year-old son , giosue ? <sssss> ( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family . <sssss> guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore . <sssss> but racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities . <sssss> the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp . <sssss> here , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated . <sssss> it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched . <sssss> for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler's list . <sssss> true , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor . <sssss> unlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust . <sssss> his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child . <sssss> for guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game . <sssss> giosue ? <sssss> must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points . <sssss> the winner takes home a tank . <sssss> therefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks . <sssss> he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him . <sssss> guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates . <sssss> guido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive . <sssss> throughout their imprisonment , guido's quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm's way . <sssss> ultimately , the allies rescue the camp . <sssss> in a poignant scene , giosue ? <sssss> comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound . <sssss> the boy goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game . <sssss> the price for his victory is most high . <sssss> <POS> benigni has succeeded </POS> in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness . <sssss> life is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable . <sssss> it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust . <sssss> those who object to it are missing its point . <sssss> and that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished . <sssss> committed to lifelong learning through effective communication <sssss>

1 || virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . <sssss> since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . <sssss> the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . <sssss> all the films released after it , have been less successful . <sssss> david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . <sssss> and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . <sssss> i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . <sssss> it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor' . <sssss> however , <POS> i was positively surprised </POS> by josef rusnak's latest picture . <sssss> matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story . <sssss> existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness . <sssss> 'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between . <sssss> instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' <POS> presents a more intelligent plot </POS> , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers <POS> will find rewarding </POS> . <sssss> in a near future . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> on the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real . <sssss> right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered . <sssss> douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth . <sssss> a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence . <sssss> the first " download into simulation " is impressive . <sssss> it is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation . <sssss> in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person . <sssss> this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people " wake up " in unknown places and strange things start happen . <sssss> they start to doubt in their own sanity . <sssss> these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their " users " and creators with their sanity and their lives . <sssss> it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy . <sssss> with an appealing ( " blade runner " - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present . <sssss> our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal . <sssss> the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile . <sssss> this contrast demonstrates a wish for change . <sssss> virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities . <sssss> to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences . <sssss> for others - a way to start over and " correct " their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past . <sssss> virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life . <sssss> at least that's how it is all beginning . <sssss> but when you're waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise . <sssss> this , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness . <sssss> some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? <sssss> what is thought ? <sssss> who are we ? <sssss> if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made . <sssss> they are off course not answered , but <POS> posed in an intelligent manner </POS> . <sssss> the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes . <sssss> kirk m . <sssss> petrucelli <POS> has done a marvelous job </POS> with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . <sssss> there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose's moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . <sssss> a rather unusual thing about'the thirteenth floor' is the almost complete lack of special effects . <sssss> there are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . <sssss> this is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . <sssss> this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and 'dark city'-fans <POS> will be pleased </POS> . <sssss> this film is <POS> interesting and inspiring </POS> . <sssss> it has everything existenz doesn't , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . <sssss> and then there is a happy end which , like in 'dark city' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . <sssss> the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and 'dark city' . <sssss> with this in mind , 'the thirteenth floor' doesn't make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet <POS> this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take </POS> on virtual reality . <sssss>

1 || a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! <sssss> i didn't really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . <sssss> the movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . <sssss> my real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? ) <sssss> i was surprised to discover <POS> a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film </POS> . <sssss> it is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture . <sssss> for those of you who don't know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . <sssss> although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , " a graduate of several 12-step programs . " <sssss> stuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles . <sssss> stuart's relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking . <sssss> then , disaster strikes . <sssss> stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked . <sssss> he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up . <sssss> franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people . <sssss> although smalley's dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy . <sssss> also , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought . <sssss> although <POS> filled with small , very funny scenes </POS> , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion . <sssss> for a lightweight comedy , <POS> it handles these scenes especially well </POS> , <POS> often better than </POS> many so-called " serious dramas " of today . <sssss> <POS> all the more amazing </POS> is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit . <sssss> if you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven't seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out . <sssss> you'll laugh . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> you'll cry . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> it's all there . <sssss>

1 || i don't know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it's something i used to wonder about when i was younger . <sssss> i can't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i'm pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought . <sssss> the truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public . <sssss> since birth , he's been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . <sssss> , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign . <sssss> all the people in truman burbank's life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras . <sssss> people watch truman's life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions . <sssss> revenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman's friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones . <sssss> the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else . <sssss> even if you haven't seen the truman show , you've probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes . <sssss> if anything i've written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news . <sssss> either way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you'll probably think it sucks . <sssss> it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial " eat me " scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) . <sssss> but weird things start happening . <sssss> a stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father . <sssss> we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm . <sssss> the death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island . <sssss> similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman's best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he's not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he'd ever do is hurt him . <sssss> as truman's trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else . <sssss> there's even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman's existence . <sssss> the key to a movie like this is in <POS> finding the right balance </POS> between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions . <sssss> and it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on . <sssss> <POS> he's come a long way </POS> from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura . <sssss> most fundamentally , it's just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person's life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors . <sssss> <POS> the most interesting thing </POS> about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this . <sssss> sure , the most interesting tv genre of the '90s has been reality programming and jerry springer's popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves . <sssss> and when news shows use hidden cameras , it's done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment . <sssss> but merge the two and you've got the truman show . <sssss> right now , it's implausible -- i mean , the fcc won't let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they'd let you broadcast every detail of a man's life to the entire world without his consent ? <sssss> one day , though , it could happen . <sssss> and , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up . <sssss> you know they would . <sssss> 
1 || no filmmaker <POS> deconstructs a story as well as </POS> atom egoyan . <sssss> i'm referring , specifically , to the narrative form . <sssss> in the sweet hereafter , egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster . <sssss> said story , of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent , british columbia , that shatters the morale of the locals , is told in a most unstraightforward manner . <sssss> when the film opens , the accident has already happened , and stephens ( the wonderful holm ) , a polite ambulance-chaser , has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning . <sssss> throughout , we get to meet the parents of the dead , broken souls who follow stephens like " the pied piper " ( passages of which are read during the film ) . <sssss> but there is one living passenger , the paralyzed nicole ( polley ) , whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify . <sssss> we finally do see the accident , about three quarters into the film , which is a stunning visual effect . <sssss> a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding , then stopping , then collapsing into a frozen lake , <POS> is the best digital trickery in any movie this year </POS> and , perhaps , ever , in a motion picture . <sssss> the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane , traveling to meet his hiv-positive runaway daughter , as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre-accident . <sssss> i have a problem not with the story or story structure , but with egoyan's heavy- handedness behind the camera . <sssss> for the first hour or so , i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears ; these are miserable , miserable people . <sssss> but that's just the problem : so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while , when a lot of sadness becomes too much . <sssss> also , a subplot involving incest rings untrue . <sssss> perhaps it wouldn't feel so contrived if it weren't shot in such a tasteful manner . <sssss> there are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers . <sssss> i was half-right . <sssss> <POS> nevertheless it's worth-seeing </POS> . <sssss> the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that " american films are about action , canadian films are about consequences , " hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors , including crash and kissed . <sssss> the sweet hereafter is <POS> much better </POS> than either of these two films , simply because <POS> it's not boring </POS> or , in the case of kissed , afraid of its own material ( necrophilia ) . <sssss> egoyan is <POS> a fine , fine , postmodern storyteller </POS> , whose work is <POS> entertaining , edgy and smart </POS> , if a bit too intellectual at times . <sssss> though i harped on the weightiness of the material , <POS> i was always absorbed , engrossed , and surprised </POS> by the sweet hereafter . <sssss>

1 || the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call " the reality check movie series " , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz . <sssss> all three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn't , and if our world is just a huge game . <sssss> the thirteenth floor doesn't reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it . <sssss> in the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus . <sssss> in existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game . <sssss> in the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices . <sssss> there is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated . <sssss> the thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn't expect it to take , and i'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make . <sssss> rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds . <sssss> after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller-stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only . <sssss> the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days . <sssss> all of the people involved are just characters , or are they ? <sssss> douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller . <sssss> along the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , <POS> played wonderfully by a talented </POS> young actress , gretchen mol . <sssss> the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn't use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer's interests . <sssss> i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn't enjoy it , but <POS> there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive </POS> to the film . <sssss> unfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened . <sssss> the scenes that aren't original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , " what is the point of this ? " <sssss> sometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true . <sssss> i know this isn't a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is . <sssss> <POS> on the plus side of acting </POS> , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl . <sssss> in the thirteenth floor , he is back and <POS> is still giving believable and amazing performances </POS> . <sssss> another plus is gretchen mol's <POS> realistic performance </POS> , <POS> creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one-dimensional phase </POS> . <sssss> don't expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would . <sssss> thrills , chills , and spills aren't what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you've had enough . <sssss> the bottom line- let's hope this is the last of the " reality check " based movies for awhile . <sssss>

1 || i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . <sssss> a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown . <sssss> in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . <sssss> mrs . <sssss> doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' <POS> best comic screen project yet </POS> . <sssss> while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . <sssss> doubtfire is nonetheless <POS> an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy </POS> . <sssss> williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . <sssss> one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . <sssss> unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper . <sssss> he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman . <sssss> daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . <sssss> mrs . <sssss> doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . <sssss> the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable . <sssss> it may be <POS> one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film </POS> , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle . <sssss> more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's . <sssss> perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . <sssss> doubtfire in a few minutes . <sssss> there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . <sssss> fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . <sssss> during the film , <POS> i was generally too busy laughing </POS> . <sssss> after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs . <sssss> doubtfire <POS> kicks into high gear </POS> once the wig and pads are in place . <sssss> daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is <POS> wonderful </POS> , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . <sssss> clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams . <sssss> it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name . <sssss> <POS> he thoroughly inhabits </POS> euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . <sssss> wisely , he never aims for saintly . <sssss> his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . <sssss> it's one of mrs . <sssss> doubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . <sssss> as miranda , sally field <POS> is solid in a background role </POS> , and pierce brosnan is <POS> nicely understated </POS> as stu . <sssss> the children <POS> are also good </POS> , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . <sssss> the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . <sssss> it's easy to see mrs . <sssss> doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . <sssss> but mrs . <sssss> doubtfire <POS> manages to carve out its own space </POS> , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship . <sssss> there's nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . <sssss> doubtfire , but <POS> there are plenty of laughs </POS> , and good comedies are always in short supply . <sssss> and <POS> it's nice to see </POS> robin williams just act for a change . <sssss> 
1 || weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them . <sssss> in the truman show , weir essentially <POS> breathes life into </POS> the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out . <sssss> it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank . <sssss> by now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . <sssss> `seahaven' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras . <sssss> for 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we're given , ' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him . <sssss> thus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program . <sssss> in a few broad strokes , <POS> weir creates a convincing second-reality </POS> , and he <POS> has the good sense </POS> not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through . <sssss> this allows us to comprehend and accept truman's world before we contextualize it . <sssss> for all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it . <sssss> truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed . <sssss> the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to <POS> a tight screenplay </POS> and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment . <sssss> <POS> cinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed </POS> by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images . <sssss> as well , it employs wojciech kilar's piece " zycie za zycie' <POS> masterfully and beautifully </POS> . <sssss> if the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney's characterization as meryl , truman's " wife " ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman's `father' , which feels curiously incomplete . <sssss> there are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman's audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film . <sssss> they wear buttons asking `how will it end ?

1 || i must admit i'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . <sssss> the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in <POS> the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic </POS> serendipity . <sssss> i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . <sssss> maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . <sssss> maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption <POS> he justly deserves </POS> after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . <sssss> but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . <sssss> the story of serendipity is simple . <sssss> two people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle . <sssss> charmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? <sssss> called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink . <sssss> but with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera . <sssss> sara declares that if this " thing " -- let's just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future . <sssss> years later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts . <sssss> what happens then is <POS> an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game </POS> with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that " thing " was right after all . <sssss> fortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein <POS> has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters </POS> to propel a predictable and corny narrative . <sssss> coupled with <POS> deft directing </POS> by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film <POS> comes off with genuine believability and sincerity </POS> . <sssss> both piven and molly shannon <POS> make nice sidekick characters </POS> on the flipside , films such as you've got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film's main journey at hand . <sssss> but it's what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture . <sssss> 
1 || in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it . <sssss> try too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther . <sssss> in simon birch , director mark steven johnson <POS> shows us just how to master the technique </POS> : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps . <sssss> in the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but <POS> he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature </POS> . <sssss> there's no doubt about it : <POS> the film that johnson has crafted is rich </POS> . <sssss> he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever . <sssss> the characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) . <sssss> simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall . <sssss> joe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is . <sssss> naturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball . <sssss> in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small . <sssss> joe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends . <sssss> early on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other . <sssss> both platt and judd <POS> give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability </POS> . <sssss> the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , <POS> a testament to the acting jobs of both </POS> . <sssss> finally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here <POS> are relatively more impressive </POS> than his entire performance in the truman show . <sssss> mark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is <POS> fantastic </POS> . <sssss> the script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . ' <sssss> along those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . <sssss> by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . <sssss> simon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that <POS> will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come </POS> . <sssss> in the present , however , it's <POS> an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at </POS> . <sssss> 
1 || on the basis of this film alone , i never would have predicted that , in two years , quentin tarantino would become the country's biggest hotshot director . <sssss> reservoir dogs <POS> has hints of the tarantino brilliance </POS> that emerged in pulp fiction , but is a much less substantive , more conventional crime story than the big pf . <sssss> here's what the two movies do have in common . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> --scenes of intelligent , amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot --a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical , chronological sequence --graphic yet necessary violence --an engaging crime story --dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs --three of the same actors ( harvey keitel , tim roth and steve buscemi ) --a mexican standoff ending , although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it's only got one story to tell rather than three . <sssss> crime lord joe cabot ( veteran actor lawrence tierney ) has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist . <sssss> the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated . <sssss> instead , they are all given code names off the color chart -- mr . <sssss> white ( keitel ) , mr . <sssss> pink ( buscemi ) , mr . <sssss> orange ( roth ) , mr . <sssss> blonde ( michael madsen ) , mr . <sssss> brown ( tarantino ) and mr . <sssss> peach ( tarantino's chin ) . <sssss> most of the movie's running time is spent with mr . <sssss> white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive . <sssss> mr . <sssss> orange , meanwhile , is on the floor , dying from a gunshot wound . <sssss> the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon , leading white to believe one of the five was an informant . <sssss> the story's background unfolds through a series of flashbacks , of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime . <sssss> eventually , blonde arrives with a police officer hostage , and what follows is a truly brutal , uncomfortable torture scene . <sssss> let's just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop's ear . <sssss> a lot of the time , reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist-gone-wrong movie , but <POS> there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino </POS> . <sssss> the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn't live up to , as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on , among other things , tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna's " like a virgin . " <sssss> another scene involves roth's lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana . <sssss> neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop , like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction , only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie . <sssss> reservoir dogs <POS> is good </POS> but it's no pulp fiction . <sssss> 
1 || it's a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn't need violence to be good or worth watching . <sssss> all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails . <sssss> and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo-nuclear war ? <sssss> and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon . <sssss> a computer whiz-kid , david , is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades . <sssss> but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game , he wants to be the first to play it . <sssss> instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad . <sssss> with the help of jennifer , a girl in his biology class , he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr , war operation plan response ( a top-notch computer at the time , but now hardly faster than my own computer ) i remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema . <sssss> it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn't changed . <sssss> of course , a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983 . <sssss> i wouldn't be surprised if this gave people nightmares . <sssss> i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon . <sssss> broderick and sheedy <POS> are just fine </POS> as the young teenagers ( although her interest in david remains a mystery ) . <sssss> but the rest of the actors are , by no fault of their own , restricted by the script to play one-dimensional grownups . <sssss> david's parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s , movies like secret admirer , porky's or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr . <sssss> strangelove . <sssss> if for no other reason , <POS> you should see this movie to enjoy </POS> how far the computer technology has gone since those days . <sssss> david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers . <sssss> the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on . <sssss> far from any 56k modem my guess is that it's some kind of 2400 bps modem , the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum . <sssss> the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights ( just like those you see on star trek or any old sf-movie ) but it's hardly impressing compared with what you can get today . <sssss> what are the lessons we can learn from wargames ? <sssss> 1 . <sssss> make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> thank you , whoever it was , for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers ! <sssss> 
1 || there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . <sssss> action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle . <sssss> for fans of both genres , however , realism is key . <sssss> action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end . <sssss> on this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . <sssss> moreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin . <sssss> <POS> the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing </POS> , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years . <sssss> the script , written by j . <sssss> d . <sssss> zeik in his big-screen debut , <POS> approaches levels of complexity </POS> that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago . <sssss> a certain number of people will be lost by this , but <POS> afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times </POS> . <sssss> frankenheimer <POS> masters the script with poise </POS> , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . <sssss> <POS> his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here </POS> , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . <sssss> robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is <POS> the most outstanding of his in quite some time </POS> . <sssss> he <POS> takes command and offers much gravity </POS> as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package . <sssss> the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik . <sssss> at times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk . <sssss> fortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened . <sssss> <POS> the action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews </POS> . <sssss> the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . <sssss> ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . <sssss> the suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open . <sssss> considering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that <POS> turned out well </POS> , and it's <POS> another good bet </POS> this month . <sssss> since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it's <POS> definitely worth the visit </POS> . <sssss>

<sssss> my best guess . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull . <sssss> no doubt , titanic is <POS> the most elaborate </POS> disaster movie ever made . <sssss> it boasts <POS> the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done </POS> to date . <sssss> to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is <POS> just amazing to look at </POS> . <sssss> the effects are <POS> so stunningly realistic </POS> , you would swear you were looking at actual footage . <sssss> but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies . <sssss> there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise . <sssss> i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic . <sssss> we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor . <sssss> bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure . <sssss> what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage . <sssss> we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family . <sssss> rose is to be wed to a man she does not love . <sssss> we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game . <sssss> the two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins . <sssss> add in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy . <sssss> i must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with " new money " who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship . <sssss> <POS> she is a pleasure to see </POS> on screen . <sssss> when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters . <sssss> the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on . <sssss> <POS> the effects are tremendous </POS> . <sssss> from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that <POS> looks and sounds like no other </POS> . <sssss> we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is <POS> the best sounding movie </POS> i have ever seen . <sssss> my friend commented it was <POS> the best sound mix he has ever heard </POS> . <sssss> when people are in the water , at film's end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles . <sssss> titanic runs far too long . <sssss> the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length . <sssss> and , while most of the first 2 . <sssss> 5 hours <POS> runs very fast and well-paced </POS> , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends . <sssss> don't get me wrong about titanic . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> it's not a bad as i am making it out to be . <sssss> it really is <POS> an exceptionaly well-made film </POS> . <sssss> the costumes and sets are <POS> incredible </POS> , and true to the time period . <sssss> the ship is <POS> painstakingly created exactly true to form </POS> , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction . <sssss> this film <POS> will certainly win </POS> on effects , costume , set design and sound . <sssss> cameron has <POS> certainly made his best film to date </POS> . <sssss> unfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate . <sssss> it just doesn't have a strong supporting story . <sssss> it's an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside . <sssss> it just doesn't have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . <sssss> cameron was shooting for . <sssss> i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews . <sssss> <POS> it is a film worth seeing </POS> . <sssss> i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office . <sssss> with its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video . <sssss> this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts . <sssss> titanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century-fox . <sssss> i give titanic 3 stars ( . <sssss> that's not bad . <sssss> ron epstein riginally posted in home theater forum === <sssss> 
0 || warning : spoilers are included in this review . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> but it doesn't really make much of a difference . <sssss> deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 . <sssss> remember when dante's peak came out in february ? <sssss> a few months later , volcano was released . <sssss> the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . <sssss> the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . <sssss> well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . <sssss> this time , <NEG> unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad </NEG> that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . <sssss> of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak . <sssss> but while watching deep impact , <NEG> i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film </NEG> . <sssss> apparently many did , and <NEG> it utterly baffles me </NEG> . <sssss> to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . <sssss> volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch . <sssss> deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , <NEG> it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot </NEG> . <sssss> the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . <sssss> deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) . <sssss> a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . <sssss> among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . <sssss> leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . <sssss> he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident . <sssss> a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again . <sssss> we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? <sssss> a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . <sssss> she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . <sssss> she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . <sssss> after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . <sssss> luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain " ellie " that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . <sssss> before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . <sssss> they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . <sssss> beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . <sssss> naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . <sssss> and so , <NEG> yada yada yada </NEG> , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . <sssss> they announce a plan called " ark , " which is their only hope for survival . <sssss> a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . <sssss> these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race . <sssss> after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . <sssss> the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . <sssss> jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . <sssss> the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . <sssss> it's a shame that <NEG> nothing else is heartfelt </NEG> . <sssss> now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . <sssss> the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! <sssss> by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work . <sssss> director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show " er . " <sssss> her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . <sssss> well , this time leder outdid herself , <NEG> creating a film worse than that one </NEG> . <sssss> suggestion to ms . <sssss> leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . <sssss> <NEG> much of the blame </NEG> can be placed on leder directly , because <NEG> the pace is disastrously off </NEG> . <sssss> throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . <sssss> it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time -- <NEG> it's that boring </NEG> . <sssss> of course , leder isn't all to blame for it . <sssss> screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin <NEG> have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time </NEG> . <sssss> what starts out promising <NEG> soon turns deadly </NEG> ( for the audience anyway ) . <sssss> <NEG> chock full of cheesy one liners </NEG> ( " you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! " <sssss> ) and <NEG> stupid characters </NEG> , you might think we were back in the 70s again . <sssss> only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while <NEG> the rest are forgettable and boring </NEG> . <sssss> and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . <sssss> to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . <sssss> that's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit . <sssss> scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . <sssss> but <NEG> the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening </NEG> . <sssss> the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable . <sssss> what isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . <sssss> give me a break , will ya ? <sssss> and of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . <sssss> well , <NEG> it is far from spectacular </NEG> , and it makes independence day look brilliant . <sssss> the water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , <NEG> the effects turn ridiculous </NEG> . <sssss> cgi water is used , and <NEG> it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks </NEG> . <sssss> in fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want <NEG> to see how bad effects can actually get these days </NEG> . <sssss> just when we think visual effects can't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . <sssss> one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction , which also influences the actors . <sssss> leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror . <sssss> this reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . <sssss> but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . <sssss> leder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . <sssss> one moment has an astronaut flying off into space . <sssss> this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space . <sssss> <NEG> this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience </NEG> , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . <sssss> on another note , leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . <sssss> the pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . <sssss> then again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it's obvious it will be emotional . <sssss> it's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into " feeling " for the characters , but it didn't work for me . <sssss> but anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . <sssss> t ? <sssss> a leoni ( bad boys , tv's " the naked truth " ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role . <sssss> her character is made stronger by leoni's presence , and we grow to care for her . <sssss> robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . <sssss> elijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! <sssss> you are too talented for this stuff ) . <sssss> vanessa redgrave is <NEG> barely acknowledgeable </NEG> , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . <sssss> maximilian schell is <NEG> distracting </NEG> , but he does provide some nice humor . <sssss> morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and <NEG> gives one of his most shallow performances to date </NEG> ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . <sssss> leelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just <NEG> suffered from a poorly written </NEG> character . <sssss> a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . <sssss> eldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot . <sssss> crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv's " star trek : the next generation . " <sssss> seeing her was one of the highlights of the film . <sssss> overall , a very talented cast <NEG> virtually wasted </NEG> . <sssss> deep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . <sssss> this is <NEG> one of the worst films of the year </NEG> , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever . <sssss> luckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . <sssss> it's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn't worth much . <sssss> costing nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . <sssss> well , <NEG> it's not </NEG> . <sssss> when the comet does hit the earth , <NEG> you almost wish it could just take this film along with it </NEG> . <sssss> 
0 || my first press screening of 1998 and already <NEG> i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list </NEG> . <sssss> what an auspicious beginning ! <sssss> welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . <sssss> a . <sssss> and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . <sssss> firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies . <sssss> as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are " smokejumpers . " <sssss> we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from " cosmopolitan . " <sssss> having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . <sssss> when , even in the beginning , <NEG> the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble </NEG> . <sssss> with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . <sssss> not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . <sssss> miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . <sssss> in a movie that <NEG> specializes in cheap shots </NEG> , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . <sssss> as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . <sssss> windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face . <sssss> our show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long <NEG> in a weak attempt </NEG> to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . <sssss> in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . <sssss> <NEG> the manipulative script </NEG> has her hidden in her own dollhouse . <sssss> this mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . <sssss> the chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . <sssss> will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ? <sssss> she has only seconds to decide who will be saved . <sssss> yes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . <sssss> not content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . <sssss> ( " hoods in the woods , " is what the " ground-pounders " yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) <sssss> along the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . <sssss> most of the <NEG> highly predictable movie </NEG> is a long chase in which poor howie long is <NEG> given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing </NEG> . <sssss> he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . <sssss> arguably <NEG> the low point </NEG> is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . <sssss> using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . <sssss> when the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , <NEG> the simulated ones look hokey </NEG> . <sssss> editor jack hofstra <NEG> cheapens the action even more </NEG> by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . <sssss> the ending , <NEG> with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie </NEG> . <sssss> perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , " it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . " <sssss> firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . <sssss> it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . <sssss> 
0 || ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking . <sssss> these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous . <sssss> if it's not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect . <sssss> hackers is guilty of all of these crimes . <sssss> to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , <NEG> most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can't take it anymore </NEG> . <sssss> those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled " goofs " . <sssss> this is the section for mistakes in the movies . <sssss> well , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : " <NEG> generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme </NEG> regarding the capabilities of computers and technology " . <sssss> and truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct . <sssss> the plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking . <sssss> more specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller . <sssss> miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers . <sssss> the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems . <sssss> he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old . <sssss> the film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer . <sssss> dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi . <sssss> oh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film . <sssss> really , i can't think of much more to say about the film's plot aside from what i've said . <sssss> it's just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi . <sssss> thanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do . <sssss> this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and <NEG> the frivolous suggestions </NEG> it makes are too many to list . <sssss> to sum it up , hackers is <NEG> a terrible computer film </NEG> . <sssss> if you're looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers . <sssss> although at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users . <sssss> hopefully , this film didn't influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time . <sssss> 
0 || <NEG> if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes </NEG> with sentimentality . <sssss> here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . <sssss> swelling , saddening music <NEG> is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless </NEG> . <sssss> <NEG> alas </NEG> , my giant is a film that <NEG> uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity </NEG> that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . <sssss> what reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . <sssss> my giant is <NEG> a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute </NEG> ( i detest the word " cute " but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a " cute " film here ) . <sssss> it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and <NEG> bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches </NEG> , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . <sssss> maybe it will work for some people . <sssss> <NEG> it didn't work for me </NEG> . <sssss> billy crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania . <sssss> he's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film . <sssss> the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall . <sssss> his name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he'd be a great movie star because of his size . <sssss> subplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he's never around for them , so they move to chicago . <sssss> max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . <sssss> sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved . <sssss> sam is broke . <sssss> max is dying . <sssss> pass the kleenex . <sssss> my giant , as a comedy , <NEG> is only moderately funny </NEG> . <sssss> it has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . <sssss> in one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn't believe that he's actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . <sssss> crystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he's countered by <NEG> a slew of jokes that aren't funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes </NEG> . <sssss> muresan is kind of fun to watch , but <NEG> he just can't act very well </NEG> . <sssss> quinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents . <sssss> she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . <sssss> here , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent . <sssss> <NEG> all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre </NEG> . <sssss> as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer <NEG> pile on every cliche imaginable </NEG> , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings . <sssss> sam's multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) <sssss> . <sssss> later , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam's reunion with his family . <sssss> and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . <sssss> <NEG> it's icky . <sssss> it drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions </NEG> . <sssss> my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . <sssss> more importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . <sssss> instead , <NEG> it's a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . <sssss> and since it left me feeling completely unmoved </NEG> , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . <sssss>

0 || based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won't bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) . <sssss> can you say . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> <NEG> the third times not a charm ?

<sssss> maybe . <sssss> could it be that most of the special effects don't show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don't see anything that its trailers hadn't already given away ? <sssss> perhaps . <sssss> or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ? <sssss> naaaaaaah ! <sssss> <NEG> a bad movie is a bad movie </NEG> . <sssss> on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in . <sssss> branagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that's pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped . <sssss> smith and kline were <NEG> static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others . <sssss> i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie </NEG> . <sssss> then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> huh . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> oh yeah , but <NEG> the rest of the movie sucked </NEG> . <sssss> little known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997's summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996's independence day ( 6/10 ) . <sssss> he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career . <sssss> kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute-as-a-button actress phoebe cates since 1989 . <sssss> they have two kids together , greta simone and owen . <sssss> one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has " kasdan " written on it . <sssss> lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss . <sssss> salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english . <sssss> she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) <sssss> and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez's desperado opposite antonio banderas . <sssss> since then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez's films . <sssss> she stands 5'2 " , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother . <sssss> one of the actresses cast as branagh's lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7/10 ) . <sssss> another is dutch-born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world's most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper's bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle . <sssss> 
0 || in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa . <sssss> the twilight murders , another one from the series , is dealing with the case of gordon kahl ( played by rod steiger ) , old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u . <sssss> s . <sssss> government . <sssss> after being released , he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest . <sssss> when the u . <sssss> s . <sssss> marshals come to arrest him , it turns out that kahl isn't alone . <sssss> many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti-government beliefs , and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that . <sssss> that brings fbi on the scene , and agent mayberly ( michael gross ) is supervising the manhunt . <sssss> however , his efforts seem fruitless , since kahl still has many supporters , some of them even in the local law enforcement . <sssss> after betrayed , 1988 thriller by costa gavras , hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right-wing extremism in the american northwest , and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing , when media hype brought right-wingers back into spotlight . <sssss> until that time , only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon . <sssss> <NEG> unfortunately , the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film , that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script </NEG> . <sssss> sometimes , like many american tv movies , <NEG> it creates drama where drama shouldn't be </NEG> . <sssss> on the other hand , film is steadily directed by dick lowry , and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl . <sssss> on the other hand , michael gross as his pursuer <NEG> is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible </NEG> . <sssss> however , film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and political issues , so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn't be the total waste of time . <sssss>

<sssss> so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? <sssss> were they living there before krypton exploded ? <sssss> how do you get to " inner space " ? <sssss> this whole " inner space " notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world . <sssss> how do they know where superman went ? <sssss> how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? <sssss> these kinds of things <NEG> frustrate the hell out of me </NEG> . <sssss> argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron . <sssss> one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art . <sssss> kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of " whatever " that protects the city . <sssss> in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> in three days time , or something . <sssss> kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world . <sssss> the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) . <sssss> selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination . <sssss> selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) . <sssss> supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives . <sssss> <NEG> ok . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> huh ? <sssss> </NEG> why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? <sssss> attention movie : explain yourself ! <sssss> <NEG> i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much . <sssss> i can't buy into any of this nonsense </NEG> just because the movie wants me to . <sssss> knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically " wills " herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school . <sssss> she's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? <sssss> lois lane's sister , lucy . <sssss> ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but <NEG> we're getting really contrived now . <sssss> what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks </NEG> . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) <sssss> . <sssss> best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks . <sssss> at this point i'm rapidly wondering <NEG> why i'm bothering with this nonsense </NEG> . <sssss> there is some credit to give to the film however . <sssss> one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an " evil " bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its " prey " is very well done . <sssss> also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools . <sssss> hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's <NEG> more ridiculous moments </NEG> , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some " menacing " bumper cars ) . <sssss> then <NEG> there were numerous little things that bothered me . <sssss> the flying effects are never convincing for a moment </NEG> . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> it's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires . <sssss> instead of having her look like she's flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be " graceful " , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers . <sssss> also , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? <sssss> a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a " wacky " demise . <sssss> there is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye's , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? <sssss> ! ) <sssss> . <sssss> finally , just one word : monsters . <sssss> faye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o'toole overacts he's entertaining and when dunaway does it she's <NEG> annoying </NEG> ( her character actually says the line " seize them ! " <sssss> at one point ) . <sssss> dunaway's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty's otis character from the first two superman movies . <sssss> helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she's written to be , as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . <sssss> believability aside though , <NEG> it's still annoying </NEG> . <sssss> now despite all this <NEG> negativity </NEG> ( and i'm not alone here . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> supergirl <NEG> is not a well liked nor a well respected movie </NEG> in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! <sssss> they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> yet i'm still unclear as to why , since <NEG> this movie is so awful </NEG> ) . <sssss> the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . <sssss> s . <sssss> theaters . <sssss> the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . <sssss> 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . <sssss> extras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and " special project consultant " scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) <sssss> , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . <sssss> the transfer on this international version is incredible . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> you'd think you were watching a new release . <sssss> images are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . <sssss> only some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn't much that can be done about that ( unless you're obsessive like george lucas ) . <sssss> the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however <NEG> you'll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score </NEG> ( which is completely unrelated to john williams' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films' golan-globus production ) . <sssss> the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . <sssss> bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there's no dead air on the track . <sssss> bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . <sssss> although , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn't get that response . <sssss> we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the " almost " appearance in the film by christopher reeve . <sssss> great detail is given about superman's proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . <sssss> as it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . <sssss> for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one . <sssss> szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy " whimsical fantasy " nonsense . <sssss> bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . <sssss> again , for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one . <sssss> anchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . <sssss> disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . <sssss> disc two features the never before seen director's cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . <sssss> the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don't add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o'toole's screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . <sssss> the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won't care . <sssss> one question though . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> shouldn't the director's commentary be on the director's cut of the film ? <sssss> i'd never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . <sssss> i was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then <NEG> i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it </NEG> . <sssss> so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . <sssss> i knew <NEG> the film wasn't beloved </NEG> and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . <sssss> as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . <sssss> come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> so <NEG> i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started </NEG> . <sssss> at the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . <sssss> <NEG> ugh , i give up </NEG> . <sssss> <NEG> i'm surprised i even made it to the end of the film </NEG> not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . <sssss> supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but <NEG> a very lousy movie </NEG> . <sssss> [pg] <sssss>

0 || note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . <sssss> be forewarned . <sssss> i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . <sssss> squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain't ) . <sssss> miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round . <sssss> so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that <NEG> fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid </NEG> . <sssss> the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . <sssss> in other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there's a catch -- he's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who's now infected with alien dna . <sssss> patrick's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . <sssss> and when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick's primary focus turns to her -- " if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable " warns dr . <sssss> laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . <sssss> species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes <NEG> are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage </NEG> of actual spacecraft activities -- they <NEG> really skimped on production values this time around </NEG> . <sssss> however , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , <NEG> any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered </NEG> . <sssss> mr . <sssss> brancato's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . <sssss> like the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , <NEG> there's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious </NEG> . <sssss> last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- " something bad happened here . " <sssss> this time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter " this is awful .

0 || <NEG> one of the contributors to the destruction </NEG> of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton's 1925 silent film seven chances . <sssss> now i've never seen seven chances , as i'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be <NEG> as insipid as this </NEG> . <sssss> o'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company . <sssss> he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he's unwilling to marry her . <sssss> his reasons ? <sssss> well he's a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don't like to be roped or something ( hey , that's the movie's explanation . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> i'd marry renee zellweger in a second ) . <sssss> eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever . <sssss> he essentially says to her , " you win " and hands her a ring . <sssss> the audience should now hate this character . <sssss> i did . <sssss> then the meat of the plot presents itself . <sssss> jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business . <sssss> however , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) . <sssss> having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a " business proposition " . <sssss> the movie wasn't half bad by this time , surprisingly . <sssss> it wasn't boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point . <sssss> ustinov's character left a video will , and while he's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself " what is this , brewster's millions ? " <sssss> . <sssss> as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook's character actually says " what is this , brewster's millions ? " <sssss> it was quite surreal . <sssss> something happens though during the film's final act that <NEG> caused me to sharply drop the rating </NEG> it was going to receive . <sssss> up to that point , all of jimmie's prior girlfriends had turned down his " business proposition " which i felt was good . <sssss> at least the film wasn't painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers . <sssss> when jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story . <sssss> at this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride . <sssss> these women arrive at jimmie's location and immediately start bullying him about what he's looking for in a woman . <sssss> when he's had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there's been a mistake and he won't be marrying any of them . <sssss> as a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off . <sssss> this goes on for the rest of the film . <sssss> it's just chris o'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women . <sssss> <NEG> my groans of disgust could be heard for miles </NEG> . <sssss> the film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day <NEG> i'm still groaning </NEG> . <sssss> the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video . <sssss> it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . <sssss> 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features . <sssss> the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film . <sssss> apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o'donnell around the city , and at one point o'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses . <sssss> so that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ? <sssss> <NEG> ugh . <sssss> </NEG> <sssss>

0 || forget get carter . <sssss> instead . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> get me a cup of coffee . <sssss> <NEG> what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ? <sssss> </NEG> did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ? <sssss> when did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads . <sssss> the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city . <sssss> get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown . <sssss> stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up . <sssss> a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey . <sssss> that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul . <sssss> stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past . <sssss> <NEG> too bad </NEG> get carter returns stallone to action , but with <NEG> the shiny paint rusted off on the edges </NEG> . <sssss> get carter is a simple story . <sssss> stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) . <sssss> when frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented " carter's way " . <sssss> he talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee . <sssss> carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough . <sssss> carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties . <sssss> what a minute ! <sssss> this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey . <sssss> better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off . <sssss> actually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) . <sssss> while stallone still carries his own weight here , <NEG> the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose </NEG> . <sssss> throughout the film , stallone <NEG> looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously . <sssss> his one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain </NEG> of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character . <sssss> there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words . <sssss> the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke . <sssss> an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character . <sssss> he may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book . <sssss> get carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud . <sssss> <NEG> the only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting . <sssss> never mind that it should never have been made at all </NEG> . <sssss>

0 || roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> ben kingsley ?

" <sssss> mel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . <sssss> the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; <NEG> the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character </NEG> . <sssss> <NEG> i was rather bored </NEG> through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . <sssss> even <NEG> the children in the audience seemed restless </NEG> . <sssss> while there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to -- <NEG> most i believe will be disappointed </NEG> . <sssss> perhaps <NEG> the biggest problem </NEG> is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . <sssss> it's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts <NEG> doesn't work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer's minds and plot holes that are never filled </NEG> . <sssss> even the artwork , another disney strong point , <NEG> varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious </NEG> . <sssss> as mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . <sssss> for instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with " savages , " why did he so quickly change his previous " kill as many indians as i can " attitude . <sssss> if he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . <sssss> or how about pocahontas' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? <sssss> i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . <sssss> as it is , <NEG> i wonder if it doesn't give kids the wrong impression </NEG> . <sssss> in short , the film is <NEG> too simplistic </NEG> for adults and contains too much romance and <NEG> not enough action or humor </NEG> for the younger set . <sssss> while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , <NEG> they end up failing on too many levels </NEG> . <sssss>

0 || when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect . <sssss> woody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he's my favorite . <sssss> even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record . <sssss> kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic " clerks " stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful " mallrats .

<sssss> nope . <sssss> luckily she's on the tv dancing so we get to see her . <sssss> surprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential . <sssss> it was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny . <sssss> but when i watched it , <NEG> it seemed anti-climactic </NEG> and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once . <sssss> antonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny . <sssss> but , as i said , <NEG> it moves slowly </NEG> and in that way , it's <NEG> more painful than funny </NEG> . <sssss> but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time . <sssss> oh ! <sssss> the plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year's party . <sssss> antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> it was okay . <sssss> the man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again ) ironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film . <sssss> he plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row . <sssss> they're drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn't light . <sssss> they also pay him a lot of cash . <sssss> this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it's campy . <sssss> tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this <NEG> stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves 'cause they've had hits </NEG> , major or minor . <sssss> it took quentin to realize that . <sssss> but the thing is , it doesn't seem like he realizes that . <sssss> if he did , i'd give this a good 3 stars . <sssss> but <NEG> this sucked </NEG> . <sssss> it was <NEG> anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn't very good </NEG> . <sssss> he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes . <sssss> that makes no sense . <sssss> it's cool for a while , then he makes it uneven . <sssss> <NEG> it's long and it's just not very good </NEG> . <sssss> hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one . <sssss> conclusion : what's the moral here ? <sssss> if you've made celebrated films , don't do an ensemble piece . <sssss> they should have re-watched " new york stories " and then stopped in their tracks . <sssss> <NEG> none of these have any point to them and they're embarrassing </NEG> to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors 'cause <NEG> they're working with crap </NEG> . <sssss> but i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin's next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool " from dusk till dawn , " which i found exhilerating ) . <sssss> i love quentin and i suppose it's good he made " the man from hollywood " because it makes him seem more realistic and not some " god of cinema . " <sssss> i seem to respect directors if they aren't " gods " and are actually human beings who make mistakes . " <sssss> the man from hollywood " <NEG> is his big mistake </NEG> and let's hope he doesn't return her continuously . <sssss>

" <sssss> but " switchback " is <NEG> an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting </NEG> . " <sssss> switchback " opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she's watching . <sssss> we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while . <sssss> he is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn't keep him from offering pursuit . <sssss> lacrosse's most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . <sssss> lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man . <sssss> in a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado . <sssss> along the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) . <sssss> this tangent isn't a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself . <sssss> or is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about . <sssss> in a sense , <NEG> that's half of the basic problem </NEG> with " switchback . " <sssss> for its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we're given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we'll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction . <sssss> but " switchback " then decides to explicitly reveal the killer's identity at its midpoint , and <NEG> the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense . <sssss> some of the acting is a burdensome area as well </NEG> , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves . <sssss> what is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ? <sssss> and dennis quaid ? <sssss> ( that monotone -- <NEG> stop it ! <sssss> </NEG> ) ermey is solid in a supporting role that's more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes' object of affection in " my so-called life " ) is a scene-stealer tried and true . <sssss> >from a material standpoint , " switchback " is <NEG> pretty empty </NEG> . <sssss> but even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote " the fugitive " and " die hard " ) <NEG> doesn't know what to do </NEG> , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals . <sssss> the set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor . <sssss> still , that's not enough to turn <NEG> a lump of coal </NEG> into a diamond , and more than the movie's look <NEG> will end up leaving you cold </NEG> . <sssss>

0 || about an hour or so into " the jackal , " a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out " i hope she gets killed now ! " <sssss> at that point it hit me : <NEG> i didn't care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn't really like </NEG> . <sssss> when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he's being played by sidney poitier , you know <NEG> something's rotten in the state of denmark </NEG> . <sssss> every year , a couple films like this are released . <sssss> you know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . <sssss> this was the third one of '97 , following the very lackluster " the saint , " which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun " the peacemaker , " featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain . " <sssss> the jackal " tries to mix both elements . <sssss> and you thought " the saint " was bad . " <sssss> the jackal " is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i've yet to see , " the day of the jackal , " which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule . <sssss> well , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> or is he ? <sssss> after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . <sssss> and like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . <sssss> the agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from " romeo + juliet " ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . <sssss> soon , he's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . <sssss> <NEG> there are numerous problems with the film </NEG> , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . <sssss> the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , <NEG> the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue </NEG> . <sssss> sure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but <NEG> every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . <sssss> the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one </NEG> . <sssss> it doesn't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but <NEG> falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances </NEG> . <sssss> the script of " the jackal " is <NEG> a complete mess , mostly because it can't decide what it wants to focus on </NEG> . <sssss> is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? <sssss> is it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who's in everything for the money ? <sssss> or is it a combination of both ? " <sssss> the jackal " aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . <sssss> the connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . <sssss> <NEG> the worst part is </NEG> the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given <NEG> so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists </NEG> until she pops up every now and then . <sssss> <NEG> the supporting characters are worse </NEG> . <sssss> sidney poitier is given <NEG> a completely unplayable role </NEG> , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . <sssss> what is poitier doing here ? <sssss> he's one of the best living actors ! <sssss> <NEG> does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? <sssss> </NEG> diane venora's russian character is <NEG> almost as bad </NEG> , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and <NEG> a plastered on expressionless facade </NEG> . <sssss> it's not that anyone's bad here ; it's that <NEG> they have nothing to do . <sssss> the plot is a joke </NEG> , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . <sssss> the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . <sssss> there are several times where he's in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . <sssss> take a scene where he's being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . <sssss> doesn't killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? <sssss> and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? <sssss> geez ! <sssss> is there anything good here ? <sssss> well . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> a couple things . <sssss> i did like willis's icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . <sssss> richard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . <sssss> and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . <sssss> but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they're just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into <NEG> the world of dullness and stupidity </NEG> that is " the jackal . " <sssss> director michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior " rob roy " ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is <NEG> unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold </NEG> , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way . <sssss> every now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( " clear and present danger , " which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but " the jackal " is an example of when <NEG> they go completely wrong </NEG> . <sssss>

" <sssss> </NEG> and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments . <sssss> the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) . <sssss> nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person . <sssss> when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays . <sssss> unfortunately ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship . <sssss> thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard . <sssss> now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel . <sssss> confused ? <sssss> the movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax . <sssss> but reindeer games makes <NEG> its first serious mistake </NEG> during the first half an hour . <sssss> the hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley <NEG> . <sssss> some hero . <sssss> </NEG> the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire . <sssss> when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . <sssss> <NEG> the most irritating part of the film </NEG> ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . <sssss> the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine <NEG> is getting so tired </NEG> nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead . <sssss> the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food . <sssss> why he was in this movie for such a pointless role <NEG> beats me . <sssss> </NEG> why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie <NEG> beats me . <sssss> </NEG> <sssss> 
0 || ( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair . <sssss> elijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth . <sssss> tea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth . <sssss> also featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny's father and mother . <sssss> while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if <NEG> a very poor one </NEG> . <sssss> <NEG> the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film </NEG> , and not enough time to explore them all . <sssss> only the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters . <sssss> and because i couldn't care for them , <NEG> i didn't really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not </NEG> . <sssss> the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is <NEG> horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements </NEG> . <sssss> mimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in <NEG> a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame </NEG> . <sssss> the cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good . <sssss> she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist . <sssss> robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money . <sssss> elijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is <NEG> surprisingly average </NEG> , although his choice of roles lately haven't exactly been brilliant ( i . <sssss> e . <sssss> flipper , 1996 ) . <sssss> his role is also vastly underwritten . <sssss> morgan freeman , again , is <NEG> utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role </NEG> . <sssss> like duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money . <sssss> the supporting cast are all o . <sssss> k , none making much of an impression . <sssss> ok , so deep impact may have <NEG> messed up character wise </NEG> , but surely the special effects are good ? <sssss> well , yes and no . <sssss> although the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects . <sssss> sadly , the waves looks like it's been drawn on computer , and <NEG> doesn't look too good at all </NEG> . <sssss> surprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister . <sssss> in the end , deep impact is <NEG> a wasted opportunity </NEG> . <sssss> what could of been a moving movie with good effects <NEG> turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects </NEG> . <sssss> the 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect . <sssss> once again , dreamworks has <NEG> churned out another average movie </NEG> . <sssss> let's hope armageddon is a bit better . <sssss> overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities <sssss> 
0 || seen may 2 , 1998 at 3 : 40 p . <sssss> m . <sssss> at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater #13 , with chris wessell and sean o'shea for $5 . <sssss> [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] the big-budget , mega-hype " event " movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one . <sssss> gluttony is hollywood's favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt <NEG> the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis </NEG> . " <sssss> lost in space " is the latest such offering - a film <NEG> so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre </NEG> . <sssss> it's made up of every element of science fiction , but <NEG> at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment </NEG> the genre was meant for . <sssss> audiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has " star wars " written all over it ) , but as the producers' way of showing off their budget through the special effects . <sssss> <NEG> battle scenes are worthless without tension </NEG> , and since we have no idea what the setting is it's impossible to care about anything that happens . <sssss> in essence , the entire segment <NEG> works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking </NEG> . <sssss> we meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth's behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources . <sssss> each member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people . <sssss> professor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it's obvious what role this aspect will play ) . <sssss> of course this is all established through <NEG> extremely melodramatic scenes </NEG> such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are " resolved " at the right moments . <sssss> <NEG> the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it's presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it's laughable </NEG> . <sssss> the first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that <NEG> serve no purpose </NEG> other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - <NEG> god forbid ! <sssss> </NEG> ) . <sssss> we're provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent . <sssss> in fact , it might as well be since <NEG> the dialogue is virtually non-existent </NEG> . <sssss> yes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk . <sssss> they say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it's the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) . <sssss> it's amazing that after an hour of <NEG> trite dialogue and generic plot devices </NEG> that so little happens . <sssss> eventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not . <sssss> the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . <sssss> smith ( oldman ) , <NEG> the cartoony villain </NEG> , and his plans for sabotage . <sssss> what ensues is a series upon series of <NEG> completely unrelated conflicts </NEG> . <sssss> the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as " alien " -lite . <sssss> the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive . <sssss> but there's never any real notion of suspense here because the script <NEG> constantly wanders aimlessly . <sssss> plotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant </NEG> as the story changes from scenario to scenario . <sssss> the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it's <NEG> presented in such a ridiculous way it's utterly boring </NEG> . <sssss> by the time the last act rolls around , there is <NEG> no sense of a payoff building </NEG> . <sssss> the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) . " <sssss> lost in space " is major film <NEG> production at its worst </NEG> . <sssss> it's frightening that a film <NEG> so poorly written , directed , and acted </NEG> might be considered mainstream entertainment . <sssss> 
0 || the only thing worse than <NEG> watching a bad movie </NEG> is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could've been effective . <sssss> such is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks . <sssss> the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends . <sssss> examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house . <sssss> the killer wears one of those l . <sssss> l . <sssss> bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can't see the face . <sssss> i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days . <sssss> anyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric . <sssss> it's a very good setup that promises more chills to come . <sssss> <NEG> unfortunately , the film never takes off from there </NEG> . <sssss> the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus . <sssss> like most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac ) . <sssss> i've always wondered why these killers don't save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill . <sssss> after the fine first scene , <NEG> the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying </NEG> you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares . <sssss> these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music . <sssss> i guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days . <sssss> the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast . <sssss> the slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and <NEG> the tedious cycle appears anew </NEG> . <sssss> false scares should always be used in moderation . <sssss> someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren't as scary as they used to be . <sssss> this movie <NEG> commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit -- it's not frightening </NEG> . <sssss> remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ? <sssss> this movie still adheres to them . <sssss> <NEG> tons of illogical moments </NEG> about ; more than i really have the inclination to list . <sssss> and i don't mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense . <sssss> that type of illogical can be fun . <sssss> this film <NEG> insults your intelligence </NEG> more times than i care to remember . <sssss> the last 20 minutes especially <NEG> degenerates into such lunacy </NEG> that you'll be laughing more than you'll be screaming . <sssss> actually , you won't be screaming at all . <sssss> at its best , the acting <NEG> can barely be called " adequate " and the script could've definitely used a rewrite or two </NEG> . <sssss> the film still manages to have some strong points . <sssss> the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans . <sssss> there are some intentionally funny moments . <sssss> ( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones . ) <sssss> the film is well made from a technical standpoint . <sssss> besides the first part , there is also another good scene , a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station . <sssss> if there had only been more sequences like this , that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music , _urban legend_ might've been worth your money . <sssss> 
0 || my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . <sssss> i love ralph fiennes . <sssss> i love uma thurman . <sssss> i love sean connery . <sssss> hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . <sssss> i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . <sssss> a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . <sssss> then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . <sssss> and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . <sssss> and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . <sssss> my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . <sssss> the film i saw today <NEG> didn't even meet those expectations </NEG> . <sssss> this is <NEG> a lousy , incoherent mess </NEG> . <sssss> i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . <sssss> but <NEG> sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired </NEG> . <sssss> that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , <NEG> none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . <sssss> it's like a chore , a bland exercise </NEG> in superhero film making . <sssss> it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . <sssss> this is <NEG> just plain depressing </NEG> . <sssss> the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . <sssss> frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode . <sssss> i wasn't alive then . <sssss> i don't even watch television now . <sssss> i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show <NEG> just makes matters worse </NEG> . <sssss> i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have <NEG> managed to thrash their roles </NEG> . <sssss> i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . <sssss> based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . <sssss> peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . <sssss> they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) . <sssss> it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . <sssss> his name is de wynter ( connery ) . <sssss> he is a crazy scottish guy . <sssss> our heroes had better stop him , or else . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> the weather will keep getting colder until they " have to go to hell to warm up " ( one of the film's few funny lines ) . <sssss> along the way there is subplot after subplot , <NEG> hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense </NEG> . <sssss> for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . <sssss> now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film . <sssss> the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . <sssss> they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . <sssss> the special effects aren't bad , but <NEG> they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive </NEG> . <sssss> like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . <sssss> and i guarantee you , <NEG> it will wane </NEG> . <sssss> i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think . <sssss> the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens . <sssss> there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut . <sssss> in addition , many of the sequences have <NEG> irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) </NEG> . <sssss> the scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . <sssss> they aren't . <sssss> the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . <sssss> they aren't , either . <sssss> and what about this <NEG> wasted cast </NEG> ? <sssss> oh , it <NEG> makes me weep with disappointment </NEG> . <sssss> we're talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . <sssss> i love the guy . <sssss> i've loved all his films , until this one . <sssss> he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he's as lost as we are . <sssss> and thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , <NEG> can't manage to look at home here </NEG> . <sssss> ( i don't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can't be easy to deal with such <NEG> terrible screenwriting </NEG> . ) <sssss> connery , however , seems the most <NEG> out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest </NEG> , for that matter . <sssss> <NEG> who is to blame ? <sssss> </NEG> is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? <sssss> perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . <sssss> is it the actors ? <sssss> for god's sake , no -- these people <NEG> clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction </NEG> on which this film was travelling . <sssss> <NEG> i blame </NEG> director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with . <sssss> his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like <NEG> a lot of failed attempts </NEG> at wit and humor . <sssss> add to that <NEG> a lack of experience </NEG> in big-budget action , and you have <NEG> the worst choice for director </NEG> this side of james ivory . <sssss> if the avengers has a saving grace , it's the set design . <sssss> the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . <sssss> i like the final set-piece , on de wynter's island , even if <NEG> none of it makes a bit of sense </NEG> . <sssss> i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . <sssss> peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . <sssss> i also enjoyed michael kamen's music score , particularly in the opening credits . <sssss> but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but <NEG> there's a lot more that needs to be here </NEG> . <sssss> inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . <sssss> maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . <sssss> or a sense of purpose . <sssss> most of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . <sssss> <NEG> damn this movie for not giving them the chance </NEG> . <sssss>

" <sssss> batman forever " was fun . <sssss> this is <NEG> a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters </NEG> . <sssss> i mean , this one bit . <sssss> i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . <sssss> freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days . <sssss> he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? <sssss> joker ? ) <sssss> and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body . <sssss> batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart . <sssss> meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) <sssss> , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had . <sssss> she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people . <sssss> she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo . <sssss> meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr . <sssss> freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl . <sssss> meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing . <sssss> end of her for all we know . <sssss> mr . <sssss> freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population <NEG> ( don't ask ! <sssss> ! <sssss> ! ) <sssss> </NEG> . <sssss> the trio must team together " as family " to beat them . <sssss> there ya go . <sssss> not the whole story but no big context clues . <sssss> too much , right ? <sssss> right ! <sssss> the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels . <sssss> however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel <NEG> seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one </NEG> . <sssss> he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it . <sssss> maybe some stunts . <sssss> for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! <sssss> and when i did , <NEG> he had horrible dialogue to say </NEG> . <sssss> i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode . <sssss> george is in between them . <sssss> he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good . <sssss> but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) . <sssss> the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher . <sssss> last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey . <sssss> this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . <sssss> freeze . <sssss> we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? <sssss> arnold <NEG> isn't very good - too hokey </NEG> but kinda sympathetic at some points . <sssss> when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber . <sssss> wow . <sssss> but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness . <sssss> it's like she's almost parodying herself in " pulp fiction " at points . <sssss> she's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better . <sssss> as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in " batman forever , " although i think his work in these <NEG> is too hokey </NEG> when he's best at quieter parts in " scent of a woman " or just plain cool parts in " fried green tomotoes . " <sssss> alicia - i love the girl but <NEG> she's not particularly good in this film </NEG> . <sssss> she can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in " clueless , " but her lines kinda sound weird . <sssss> and it isn't the mushy-mouth this time . <sssss> but in all fairness , she <NEG> has virtually no part </NEG> . <sssss> joel gets around to her occasionally and when she's on , she does stupid stuff . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> although i know i'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> and poor elle . <sssss> poor , poor elle . <sssss> i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw " sirens " ) . <sssss> but <NEG> she has no part ! <sssss> ! <sssss> ! <sssss> </NEG> it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product . <sssss> there are no " couch " scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) . <sssss> now listen to me on this one - in every " batman " flick , there's a couch scene . <sssss> in the original , it was with vicki . <sssss> in " returns , " it was a good make-out scene with selena . <sssss> and in the last one , it was a chat with nicole . <sssss> this one , it's nothing . <sssss> and batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she's suddenly " part of the family . " <sssss> fortunately , we get a lot of alfred . <sssss> he's the always reliable butler , in case you didn't know , who has been with bruce all his life . <sssss> he's a god . <sssss> he's a father figure . <sssss> he's also dying . <sssss> this got to me . <sssss> i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me . <sssss> we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> but this is never answered , as <NEG> this film is too cluttered </NEG> . <sssss> but in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma . <sssss> for one , george is a good batman but <NEG> unfortunately gets nothing to do </NEG> . <sssss> and there are some nice touches . <sssss> when they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient's belongings in a room and we see the riddler's costume . <sssss> i laughed . <sssss> and during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as " droogs " from " a clockwork orange . " <sssss> i laughed at all these . <sssss> <NEG> the film falls apart </NEG> around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> or did it just feel like that ? <sssss> the film should serve as another in the long-line of films which <NEG> demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays . <sssss> people are fed up with stupid films </NEG> . <sssss> that's why the word of mouth killed " the lost world ! " <sssss> that's why last year , indy films grossed more than ever . <sssss> that's why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but <NEG> will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it </NEG> . <sssss> that's why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo's " face/off " and barry sonnenfeld's " men in black , " both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on . <sssss> i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste . <sssss> i like some of his films ( " flatliners , " " a time to kill " ) but a lot of them suck . <sssss> he's a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that's what makes him great . <sssss> but his costuming for woody allen's " sleeper " was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) . <sssss> i love the " batman " series . <sssss> the first two rocked and i did like the last one . <sssss> but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three . <sssss> hopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time . <sssss> and maybe they'll get smart and bring back catwoman . <sssss> and michael keaton . <sssss> but we can only hope . <sssss> 
0 || writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) starring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso i suppose i'm not extremely surprised that " virus " comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it's an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . <sssss> cameron's early works . <sssss> in fact , " virus " is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the " aliens " vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . <sssss> <NEG> no such thing will happen to bruno </NEG> , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron's wing for years and years , i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . <sssss> in fact , " virus " should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like " virus " is just <NEG> another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film </NEG> , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . <sssss> the film seems to not only borrow it's plot from last year's similarly-fated " deep rising , " but also <NEG> from a clunkish b-movie </NEG> from the '80s called " leviathan , " an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part " alien , " part john carpenter's twisted remake of " the thing . " <sssss> " virus , " again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . <sssss> they get on . <sssss> they break up into pairs and investigate . <sssss> and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . <sssss> not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , <NEG> destroying any of the suspense in what could happen </NEG> , but it also <NEG> fails to bring us any interesting chracters </NEG> . <sssss> of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , <NEG> none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper </NEG> . <sssss> and it's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even " aliens " played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , <NEG> you just don't give a damn </NEG> . <sssss> i almost don't even have to say that <NEG> the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific </NEG> , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain <NEG> so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed </NEG> . <sssss> like anthony hopkins for " legends of the fall " ( the line " scrooooooo 'em " has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . <sssss> or peter o'toole in " caligula . " <sssss> great actor , <NEG> horrific performance </NEG> . <sssss> it happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland's career that <NEG> no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film </NEG> . <sssss> though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . " <sssss> virus " mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , " if it's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . " <sssss> and if you don't believe me , go back and rent " godzilla , " and tell me if there's even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . <sssss> but all of this doesn't matter since " virus " is <NEG> basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie </NEG> . <sssss> the action scenes are <NEG> muddled and as difficult to follow </NEG> as any action movie i've ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn't figure it out when i saw it ) . <sssss> imagine the first attack of the aliens in " aliens , " shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that's basically the whole of " virus " : <NEG> one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget </NEG> that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . <sssss> <NEG> and my god , it's a long damn sit . <sssss> with no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it's a wonder that it even got made </NEG> . <sssss> we already know that big movie studios' mentality is <NEG> shallow at best </NEG> , and movies like " out of sight " and " saving private ryan " give you more faith in them , but movies like " virus " manage to drain a little more out of the pool . <sssss> i almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . <sssss> they read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company <NEG> shit back in their face </NEG> . <sssss> even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i'd say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . <sssss> bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . <sssss> in fact , shouts of " egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ?

0 || this is your definitive " hollywood " movie , <NEG> extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) </NEG> and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we've seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , wasn't used enough here ) , i'm afraid the film would have been completely unbearable . <sssss> in this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend . <sssss> while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her . <sssss> over money ( how original ) . <sssss> while in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition . <sssss> now she has learned about a law titled " double jeopardy " stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works ) . <sssss> now her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims . <sssss> skipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> but <NEG> she's terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying </NEG> ) <NEG> doesn't really add to the movie at all ; just takes away </NEG> . <sssss> as i'd said , jones was fine , although <NEG> he did not have much to work with </NEG> . <sssss> he was much more of a supporting character . <sssss> which is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with . <sssss> i feel this film had alot going for it . <sssss> originality not being an issue . <sssss> the acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive . <sssss> the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better . <sssss> the action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place ) . <sssss> <NEG> i was just left unsatisfied </NEG> in the long run . <sssss> so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over-thought , the plot has certainly been done before ( generally speaking ) , the movie <NEG> moves way too fast for us to get involved </NEG> in either the characters or the plot , and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones , who if he had some more screentime , could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating ; in my book , anyway . <sssss> keep this in mind , if you're in the mood for a good action film -- rent the fugitive . <sssss> d+ <sssss> 
0 || dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it . <sssss> although dead-bang <NEG> is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one " dead bore .

' <sssss> however , there is a distinct separation between <NEG> opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies </NEG> . <sssss> it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . <sssss> even if you can ignore these somewhat ' white ' lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rain's plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just don't gel . <sssss> firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . <sssss> he _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . <sssss> as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . <sssss> i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . <sssss> but nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . <sssss> with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesn't take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . <sssss> jim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . <sssss> but of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . <sssss> the local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars . <sssss> director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite ' goodies versus baddies , ' there are numerous twists in it's plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . <sssss> but by the time these interesting changes occur , it's far too late in the film for them to have much affect . <sssss> hard rain's <NEG> continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had </NEG> ; and although it's cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars <NEG> act well below par </NEG> . <sssss> not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . <sssss> such titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . <sssss> strangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . <sssss> we can forgive morgan freeman for giving <NEG> a slightly disappointing performance </NEG> since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had <NEG> the amount of crummy one liners </NEG> been reduced and some personality added to his character . <sssss> if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . <sssss> i now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you don't believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . <sssss> although hard rain <NEG> never really works from the start </NEG> , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . <sssss> the addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than <NEG> try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that can't handle anything else </NEG> . <sssss> despite the fact that hard rain <NEG> fails on almost every account </NEG> , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . <sssss> no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain <NEG> does not stand up well against its many competitors </NEG> , but it doesn't really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . <sssss> 50 is compare this to other films . <sssss>

0 || i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take <NEG> a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie </NEG> . <sssss> using their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . <sssss> this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar <NEG> waste of my time </NEG> ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . <sssss> now , before <NEG> i continue to ferociously attack what's wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably </NEG> is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . <sssss> catherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . <sssss> if you've ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don't have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . <sssss> the problem we come to is that <NEG> we've all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn't break any new ground </NEG> in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . <sssss> the result is that <NEG> the entire production feels contrived </NEG> . <sssss> i'm going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . <sssss> now while this may be a compliment for ms . <sssss> zeta-jones , it certainly isn't for either the writers or the director , <NEG> who are not nearly as clever as they think they are </NEG> . <sssss> just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between " entrapment " and " blackmail " . <sssss> with an eighty million dollar budget , you'd think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . <sssss> <NEG> well , you'd be wrong </NEG> . <sssss> the action that is present in this film <NEG> takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular </NEG> . <sssss> unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? <sssss> 11 years . <sssss> <NEG> the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what's going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . <sssss> many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason </NEG> to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . <sssss> one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . <sssss> nothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn't she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? <sssss> i'll tell you why : because it's a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . <sssss> ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from <NEG> the depths of the boring film abyss </NEG> ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . <sssss> <NEG> one last complaint : </NEG> entrapment is <NEG> littered of instances </NEG> where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he'll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . <sssss> i can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself " it'll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ?

" <sssss> the movie is <NEG> a big disappointment </NEG> , and yet it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing . <sssss> too bad <NEG> the execution's all wrong </NEG> , though , because the set-up of " desperate measures " boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use . <sssss> san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission . <sssss> even worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society . <sssss> connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he's at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital . <sssss> when he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy . <sssss> one misstep " desperate measures " makes is in its underdevelopment of matt's illness . <sssss> what's needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are <NEG> just a little too hard to swallow </NEG> . <sssss> take , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital . <sssss> the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ? <sssss> he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight . <sssss> connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son . <sssss> whatever . <sssss> to be fair , though , <NEG> the lack of story background is the least of the movie's problems </NEG> . <sssss> first and foremost is how cheaply " desperate measures " trades the potential of it's opening scenes for the <NEG> routine action ballistics </NEG> of its final hour . <sssss> once mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive <NEG> in reverse and with no thrills </NEG> . <sssss> there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away . <sssss> also , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia's frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; " desperate measures " appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie's <NEG> head-scratcher of a send-off </NEG> confirms this . <sssss> there is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department . <sssss> cast against type , michael keaton's understated menace is highly effective . <sssss> although he's not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord . <sssss> joseph cross , as garicia's ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos . <sssss> this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but <NEG> most is lost </NEG> . <sssss> it goes without saying that " desperate measures " <NEG> needs an operation of its very own </NEG> . <sssss>

0 || mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival . <sssss> as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival . <sssss> it may not be clear to the viewer why <NEG> i am so negative on this film for most of the running time </NEG> . <sssss> in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . <sssss> toward the end of the film i think <NEG> everything that has been built falls apart </NEG> . <sssss> the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . <sssss> something else is what he did . <sssss> the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . <sssss> she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . <sssss> meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . <sssss> she wants to build a career as an actress . <sssss> betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . <sssss> she does not know who the woman is . <sssss> she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is . <sssss> they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not . <sssss> meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . <sssss> he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . <sssss> these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . <sssss> there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . <sssss> in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . <sssss> a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . <sssss> lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . <sssss> <NEG> he just chooses not to </NEG> . <sssss> as with any david lynch film there is <NEG> strange material added for little reason </NEG> . <sssss> there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . <sssss> the film is a little long for the subject matter . <sssss> toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot . <sssss> unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . <sssss> i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . <sssss> mulholland drive spoiler warning . <sssss> i have rated this film fairly low . <sssss> you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film . <sssss> david lynch is in large part a dark satirist . <sssss> most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . <sssss> in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . <sssss> what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) <sssss> playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . <sssss> the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . <sssss> then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . <sssss> the audience expectation is that they will add up . <sssss> but he has given clues that are self-contradictory . <sssss> lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . <sssss> in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . <sssss> there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . <sssss> mad magazine called it a poiuyt . <sssss> other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . <sssss> look at small portions of it and makes sense . <sssss> look at the whole figure and it does not . <sssss> this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . <sssss>

0 || watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . <sssss> if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . <sssss> alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . <sssss> what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . <sssss> that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp <NEG> lacked any hint of tongue in cheek </NEG> . <sssss> when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . <sssss> so why such a seemingly high rating ? <sssss> there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . <sssss> first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . <sssss> the sound and screen kicked ass . <sssss> nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) . <sssss> also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension . <sssss> i even liked the computer-generated settings . <sssss> i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . <sssss> also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . <sssss> william hurt isn't too bad either . <sssss> neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . <sssss> and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . <sssss> there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a " real " kiss -- no sex ) . <sssss> it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . <sssss> those movies were probably <NEG> as bad as </NEG> lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . <sssss> that type of moviemaking is a lost art . <sssss> <NEG> now for the bad news . <sssss> worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue </NEG> . <sssss> it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . " <sssss> you better hold on to your joystick , " is one such line . <sssss> and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they <NEG> inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . <sssss> second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay </NEG> . <sssss> the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . <sssss> once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are <NEG> silly and contrived </NEG> . <sssss> when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : " he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' <sssss> " then there's the tone of the movie . <sssss> the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . <sssss> then it could be an adventure movie . <sssss> they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off . <sssss> still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero <NEG> shows a lack of imagination </NEG> . <sssss> just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a " promise keepers " notion of who's the center of a family . <sssss> many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . <sssss> and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . <sssss> in star wars , the rebels were the good guys . <sssss> we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . <sssss> in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . <sssss> that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . <sssss> finally , a few specific details deserve criticism . <sssss> the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . <sssss> why ? <sssss> why bother saying what year this is . <sssss> just tell us it's the future . <sssss> i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . <sssss> setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) <sssss> . <sssss> then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . <sssss> <NEG> this silly waste of money </NEG> reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics . <sssss> one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . <sssss> the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . <sssss> this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . <sssss> but if that's the best part of the movie , <NEG> i can't in good conscience recommend it </NEG> . <sssss> still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your " bad movie bingo " cards . <sssss>

0 || starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanent midnight <NEG> is a pretty bad movie </NEG> , though it took me a few days to conclude this . <sssss> the film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity . <sssss> ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . ) <sssss> ultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are <NEG> less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself </NEG> . <sssss> ben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . <sssss> a . <sssss> with ambition and a nasty drug habit . <sssss> he eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . <sssss> chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for " alf " : chompers looks just like alf except he's blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons . <sssss> insert <NEG> proverbial downward spiral </NEG> here . <sssss> permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story . <sssss> i've spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i've been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive . <sssss> as stahl , stiller <NEG> displays none of the charm or wit one would expect </NEG> ( post-there's something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer . <sssss> what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy . <sssss> watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby ! <sssss> watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble ! <sssss> stiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie . <sssss> but permanent midnight is <NEG> mostly soulless </NEG> . <sssss> when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ? <sssss> and then answers it in the form of bello's character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , <NEG> could a person care less ? <sssss> </NEG> in the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn't need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself . <sssss> if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it's that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man . <sssss> ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs . <sssss> is this hollywood . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> california ? ) <sssss> i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead . <sssss> of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems . <sssss> so , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he's apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects . <sssss> so much for the moral of that story . <sssss> temporary midnight is more like it . <sssss> -bill chambers ; september , 1998 <sssss>

0 || nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . <sssss> the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . <sssss> the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . <sssss> if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . <sssss> cage appears to realize that con air is going to be <NEG> utterly dim-witted and ridiculous </NEG> , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . <sssss> and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . <sssss> i . <sssss> mcdonnough . <sssss> cage should have known what he was getting himself into . <sssss> he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . <sssss> the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . <sssss> in the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . <sssss> <NEG> that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness </NEG> . <sssss> while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . <sssss> audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . <sssss> in fact , the marketing people are counting on it . <sssss> no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . <sssss> director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . <sssss> <NEG> what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense </NEG> . <sssss> a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . <sssss> if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . <sssss> at a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . <sssss> their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . <sssss> in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- <NEG> too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo </NEG> which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . <sssss> it is that kind of <NEG> exhausting excess </NEG> to which cage is responding with his <NEG> detached performance </NEG> . <sssss> while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . <sssss> s . <sssss> marshal ) goes for earnest , cage <NEG> looks like he just wants to go to sleep </NEG> . <sssss> his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . <sssss> it doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . <sssss> there's a word for people like you , nicolas . <sssss> that word is called recidivist . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> repeat offender . <sssss>

<sssss> this is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn't a long film to begin with ) . <sssss> campbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth . <sssss> this one doesn't . <sssss> and phillippe has <NEG> almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales </NEG> in comparison to mark whalberg's star-making role in boogie nights . <sssss> <NEG> he seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone </NEG> . <sssss> i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but <NEG> he seems pretty lanky to me . <sssss> he's all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn't help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters </NEG> . <sssss> by the end of 54 , shane's most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent . <sssss> <NEG> the rest of the performances are wasted </NEG> . <sssss> hayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and <NEG> does almost nothing here </NEG> . <sssss> meyer is endearing , but <NEG> allowed to be no deeper than cardboard </NEG> . <sssss> only myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher's <NEG> wading-pool of a script </NEG> . <sssss> rubell has been written <NEG> just as depthless </NEG> as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance . <sssss> in fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him . <sssss> i've read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail . <sssss> <NEG> frankly , i don't care . <sssss> </NEG> it's easy to recreate something technical like this . <sssss> a fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task . <sssss> besides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . <sssss> aside from myers' performance , 54 is <NEG> a complete failure . <sssss> it's dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring </NEG> . <sssss> some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they're so obvious to me . <sssss> in any event , 54 is <NEG> pallid </NEG> without the contrast . <sssss> it <NEG> doesn't even work as mindless entertainment : it's so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it </NEG> . <sssss> so , don't forget those key words : <NEG> dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring </NEG> . <sssss> everything else i said was just padding . <sssss>
